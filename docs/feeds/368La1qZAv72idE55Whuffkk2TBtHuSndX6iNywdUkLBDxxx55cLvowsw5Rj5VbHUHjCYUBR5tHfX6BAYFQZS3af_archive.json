Most independent polls show Tisza with a significant lead before the April 12 vote, an advantage which has held steady for more than a year. </p><p>“We’re standing on the threshold of victory with 56 days left to go,” he told supporters during his speech at an exposition center in Budapest on Sunday. “Tisza stands ready to govern.” </p><p>Magyar has  across Hungary’s rural, conservative heartland — traditionally an Orbán stronghold — holding rallies and town hall events in scores of villages and towns. He has focused on bread and butter issues such as low wages and rapidly rising living costs that have made Hungary one of the poorest countries in the European Union. </p><p>Magyar accuses Orbán and his government of mismanaging Hungary’s economy and social services, and overseeing unchecked corruption he says has led to the accumulation of extreme wealth within a small circle of well-connected insiders while leaving ordinary Hungarians behind. </p><p>He has also criticized Orbán for conducting a combative foreign policy with the EU while maintaining close ties to Russia despite its war in neighboring Ukraine. </p><p>“Hungary’s place is in Europe, not only because Hungary needs Europe, but also because Europe needs Hungary,” he said. </p><p>Magyar’s comments contrasted starkly with statements Orbán made a day earlier at his own campaign launch, where  was not military aggression from Russia, but the European Union. </p><p>In a 239-page program released last week, Tisza outlined its plans for how it would govern Hungary if it wins April’s elections. Fidesz has not released a program, arguing that after governing for 16 years, its voters know what kinds of policies to expect. </p><p>On Sunday, Magyar reiterated that his party plans to retain a fence Orbán’s government built along the country’s southern border in 2015, and said he would maintain Fidesz’s policies of opposing illegal immigration and any accelerated procedure for Ukraine to join the EU. </p><p>However, Magyar has vowed to bring home billions in funding the EU has  over its concerns that Orbán has eroded democratic institutions, reduced judicial independence and failed to tackle corruption. </p><p>The program also pledges to fulfill conditions for adopting the euro currency by 2030, and to invest in Hungary’s faltering state health care and public transportation sectors. Tisza also plans to crack down on corruption and recover public funds it argues have been funneled into the hands of government-connected oligarchs.</p><p>“It is time to call corruption what it is: theft,” Magyar said Sunday.</p><p>For its candidates in each of Hungary’s 106 individual voting constituencies, Tisza has largely drawn on political neophytes locally active as entrepreneurs, doctors, economists, educators and other professionals. </p><p>Leading the ticket alongside Magyar are international energy expert Anita Orbán (no relation to the prime minister), whom the party tapped as its prospective foreign policy chief, and former Shell executive István Kapitány, who would fill a senior economy position in a future Tisza government. </p><p>Such candidates, Magyar has argued, will provide sectoral expertise he says is lacking under Orbán’s government, and will help rebuild relations with Western partners and end Hungary’s international isolation. </p><p>“I am proud that our experts are once again showing what it means to take the country’s fundamental issues seriously and to plan our shared future,” he said Sunday. “We don’t plan to dominate this country, but to serve it.”</p>","contentLength":4115,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r5mq1j/hungarian_opposition_leader_magyar_vows_to_pull/"},{"title":"Russia’s Wagner Group pivots to European sabotage, say western officials","url":"https://www.ft.com/content/dbd1d803-ab37-43f1-920f-fce74952313a","date":1771180985,"author":"/u/homeinthecity","guid":363,"unread":true,"content":"<div aria-hidden=\"true\" data-offer-type=\"print\"><ul></ul></div>","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r5mdt6/russias_wagner_group_pivots_to_european_sabotage/"},{"title":"Starmer has grasped what his predecessors would not – that Britain is better off in Europe than with the US","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/starmer-nato-europe-us-trump-defence-ukraine-b2920255.html","date":1771175216,"author":"/u/rezwenn","guid":368,"unread":true,"content":"<p>There will be consternation in some quarters of the nation’s armed forces, particularly the Special Forces, but ending the junior partner status of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/britain\">Britain</a> under the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/us\">US</a> puts an end to the fantasy of the “special relationship”.</p><p>The PM has grasped a barbed wire nettle many of his predecessors could not even see when he stands up at the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/munich-security-conference\">Munich Security Conference</a> to say: “There is no British security without Europe, and no European security without Britain. That is the lesson of history – and it is today’s reality too.” </p><p>He has insisted the US remains an indispensable ally. But he is now insisting that America is<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/munich-security-conference-2026-ukraine-europe-trump-russia-b2918260.html\"> no longer the only ally</a> and recognising that Washington is not even a reliable friend.</p><p>It has been a long time coming. But it has not always been the case.</p><p>Until the end of the Cold War, Britain and the US had a more equal partnership. It was underpinned by the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing relationship with Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the US and UK, but London showed fierce independence.</p><p>The UK stayed out of the Vietnam war. The US gave little to no support to Britain’s recapture of the Falkland Islands from Argentina in 1982. </p><p>When the US led a multinational UN-sanctioned mission to end warlordism and mass starvation in Somalia in 1992, France, Turkey, Morocco, Pakistan and numerous other nations joined a mission of noble intent. But not Britain.</p><p>In those days, it was recognised by a British defence attache in Washington, a major general, that the “special relationship is special to us but not to the Americans”.</p><p>“They’re polite and courtly and always seem to listen. Then they close the door behind us when we’ve gone and ignore what we said. It made us feel important but we mattered little to them,” he said before the UK joined the US in the ill-fated war in Iraq and the two-decade fiasco of Afghanistan.</p><p>In taking Britain into the Iraq war, the UK became a sub-unit of the US military and in the decade of the so-called war on terror that followed, that status was cemented by underfunding and overreliance on the equipment known as “enablers” – the satellite imagery, air transport and refuelling, and the logistics chains that the US leads the world in providing. </p><p>Then, last year, 80 years of assumptions about the UK’s future defences were upended by the Trump administration when the junior relationship was downgraded.</p><p>Writing on Substack this week, Tom Tugendhat, a Tory backbencher and former chair of the defence select committee (and former frontline intelligence officer), said: “British defence policy rested on four pillars. The assumption of automatic American support. The credibility of Nato as a guaranteed security provider. The stability of long-term defence planning. And the political consensus that defence could remain a secondary concern. Within the first fifty days of <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/donald-trump\">Donald Trump</a>’s return to the White House, all four were effectively dismantled.”</p><p>Britain’s Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, each (officially) comprising four squadrons of tier 1 “operators”, are the only units with which the UK and US are on parity. The Americans have about the same number of their most highly trained soldiers. </p><p>For the last 25 years, they have worked hand in glove. Britain’s military reputation with the US has largely rested on this relationship; even though the UK lacked the specialist equipment and aircraft their cousins could call on, they enjoyed access to the very best kit through that relationship.</p><p>Elsewhere, the UK has fared less well from the relationship. In Iraq, American and Iraqi troops had to bail the British out of a disastrous campaign in Basra and the south of the country. In Helmand, embattled British-led troops in southern Afghanistan were again bailed out by a 30,000-person surge by US Marines.</p><p>For the Americans, it has been good to have the British along. Frontline soldiers deeply appreciated the panache and bravery of the UK’s fighting men and women. But they were never militarily necessary. </p><p>The British army, now around 72,000, is less than half the size of the US Marine Corps, 172,000. Active service personnel in the whole of the British armed forces are less than the marines can field – and on top of that, the marines have their own jets, transport, artillery and ships. They can operate with far greater direct punch and autonomy than the British. There are more of them, they have better equipment, and they’re all from the same unit.</p><p>The threat to the UK is from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/russia\">Russia</a>. So it makes sense to concentrate military efforts and improve military capacity in Europe, and with European forces.</p><p>“We are not the Britain of the Brexit years any more. Because we know that, in dangerous times, we would not take control by turning inward – we would surrender it. And I won’t let that happen,” the prime minister said.</p><p>“I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full, and remakes the ties that have served us so well.”</p><p>He is right to argue that Europe and the UK need to invest in their own arms manufacturing capability and wean themselves off American-made equipment. A rapid end to duplication across the continent will be essential for the region to better cope with the autonomy that Trump is thrusting upon it with his threats against Greenland and his general contempt for Nato.</p><p>Britain’s Royal Navy is the most powerful in Europe, with two aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines, with the total tonnage of vessels greater than the German, French and Italian navies combined. France has more people in its forces, around 200,000, and a larger army, but the UK has more specialised units focused on fast deployment. </p><p>Poland’s forces are fast-growing, with around 215,000 on active service, and it is arming at a staggering pace. Turkey is Nato’s second-largest force of about 440,000 after the US (1.3 million).</p><p>But in more directly working in Europe and as a European nation, the UK’s forces will have the opportunity to be the first among equals in cooperating over defending against a real and present danger in the Kremlin, and dealing with Moscow’s grey, or hybrid, war that’s already being fought across Europe.</p><p>They’ll be joined, no doubt, by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>’s 800,000-plus battle-hardened veterans and Kyiv’s fast-growing military-industrial sector.</p><p>“We want to bring our leadership in defence, tech and AI together with Europe – to multiply our strengths and build a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production,” Sir Keir said.</p><p>Trump has insisted that is what he wants to see. But when it starts to happen, an independent Europe will leave America much enfeebled.</p>","contentLength":6814,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r5jvvn/starmer_has_grasped_what_his_predecessors_would/"},{"title":"TikTok Germany manipulation: 3M posts influencing minds, exposed","url":"https://cybernews.com/news/germany-tiktok-telegram-politics/","date":1771173334,"author":"/u/Wagamaga","guid":367,"unread":true,"content":"","contentLength":0,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":"https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/1r5j2ub/tiktok_germany_manipulation_3m_posts_influencing/"},{"title":"Outgoing Dutch Defense Secretary Tuinman: If the US blocks F-35 software updates, we will crack the code and do our own updates to make the plane fully European.
