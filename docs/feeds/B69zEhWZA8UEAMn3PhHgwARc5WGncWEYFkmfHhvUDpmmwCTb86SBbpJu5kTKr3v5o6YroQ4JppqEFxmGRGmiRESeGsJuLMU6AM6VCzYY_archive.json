A dynamic module is a shared library that can be loaded by Envoy at runtime, offering an alternative to existing extension mechanisms like Lua, External Processing, or Wasm.\n\nOur early benchmark results in a production environment demonstrate that dynamic modules perform almost identically to native C++ extensions, which was nearly impossible before. Developing native C++ extensions requires rebuilding the Envoy binary and entails significant maintenance. In contrast, dynamic modules can be developed in almost any programming language, hence greatly benefits vendors and end users who require performance-sensitive custom business logic with the minimum maintenance.\n\nIn this talk, as the maintainer of dynamic module support in Envoy, I will provide an overview of this feature, share recent updates, and discuss future developments.\n\nDon't miss out!
