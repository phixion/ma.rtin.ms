This session will provide a comprehensive overview of gRPC, highlighting its core principles, benefits, and practical use cases. We'll explore how gRPC leverages HTTP/2 for efficient, bi-directional streaming and Protocol Buffers for language-agnostic, strongly-typed data serialization. Whether you're building microservices, real-time applications, or polyglot environments, discover why gRPC is a powerful choice for high-performance, low-latency communication.</article>","contentLength":1003,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/wGIGTjZBVhk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Dial Once, Scale Infinitely: Production-Ready gRPC Without the Mess - Aparna Prabhu & Saubhik Singh","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNg2Jx4LDlo","date":1770256084,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":527,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!

The challenge is to deliver complex, user-defined reports with sub-second latency to a dynamic UI. A traditional REST/JSON approach crumbles under the weight of large, blocking responses and verbose payloads.\n\nThis session will dive into how we built a high-performance reporting backend using gRPC and server-side streaming to solve this problem. We'll explore our journey from initial design to production, demonstrating why gRPC was the clear winner for our data-intensive application. Attendees will learn how we use Protobuf to define complex, strongly-typed query contracts and leverage stream responses to send data back to the client as it becomes available, dramatically improving perceived performance and user experience. We will contrast this directly with the limitations of RESTful services for large, tabular data retrieval.</article>","contentLength":1476,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/xTTs9wlL0gk?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Keynote: Welcome + Opening Remarks - Kevin Nilson, Google","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTsWtTpKE8Q","date":1770256083,"author":"CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]","guid":519,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Don't miss out!
