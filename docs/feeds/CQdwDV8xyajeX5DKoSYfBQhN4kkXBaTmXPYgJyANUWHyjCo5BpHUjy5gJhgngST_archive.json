It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to securely connect AI models with data sources while maintaining provider freedom. This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.\n \nFor enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand. It's likely to pressure Red Hat and Canonical to follow suit, redefining what \"AI-ready\" means for Linux in corporate environments.","contentLength":1157,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Nearly 90% of Windows Games Now Run on Linux, Latest Data Shows","url":"https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/10/28/206219/nearly-90-of-windows-games-now-run-on-linux-latest-data-shows?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1761684600,"author":"msmash","guid":253,"unread":true,"content":"Nearly nine in ten Windows games can now run on Linux systems, according to data from ProtonDB compiled by Boiling Steam.

The end goal? Getting professionals ready for the actual challenges they will face on the job. The learning platform is already live with its first course offering, the System Administrator track (with three certification exams), which is tailored for anyone looking to validate their Linux and Ubuntu expertise. \n\nThe exams use cloud-based testing environments that simulate real workplace scenarios. Each assessment is modular, meaning you can progress through individual exams and earn badges for each one. Complete all the exams in this track to earn the full Sysadmin qualification... Canonical is also looking for community members to contribute as beta testers and subject-matter experts (SME). If you are interested in helping shape the platform or want to get started with your certification, you can visit the Canonical Academy website. \n\nThe sys-admin track offers exams for Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop 2024, Ubuntu Server 2024, and \"managing complex systems,\" according to an official FAQ. \"Each exam provides an in-browser remote desktop interface into a functional Ubuntu Desktop environment running GNOME.

You can also configure whether you want the wallpaper to switch between its light and dark versions based on the color scheme, the time of day, or be always light or dark.\n \nNext up is a \"Pinned clipboard items\" feature, which lets you save text you use regularly into the clipboard. Breeze-themed windows will now have the same level of roundness in all four corners, even the bottom one. Flatpak Permissions page has been transformed into a general Application Permissions page, where you can configure applications' ability to do things like take screenshots and accept remote control requests. The utility that reads the level of ink or toner from your printer now informs you when it's running low or empty.\n \nFor the gamers out there, you can now see more relevant info about game controllers on System Settings' Game Controller page. Artists among you can now configure any rotary dials and touch rings on your drawing tablet. Users sensitive to color can now make use of a grayscale color filter, which desaturates or removes color systemwide.\n \nPlasma 6.5 implements support for an experimental version of the Wayland picture-in-picture protocol that promises to allow apps like Firefox to eventually display proper PiP windows that stay above others automatically. Support for \"overlay planes\" was added, which can reduce CPU usage and power draw when displaying full-screen content using a compatible GPU.
