These teams are compressing the design, build, deploy, operate, scale cycle of their infrastructures down to months, while managing massive footprints with lean teams. How? By applying modern intent-driven infrastructure automation principles to greenfield deployments. We'll explore how these teams carry design intent through to production, and how operating and automating around consistent infrastructure data is compressing \"time to first train\".</p><p>Kris Beevers is the Co-founder and CEO of NetBox Labs. NetBox is used by nearly every Neocloud and AI datacenter to manage their networks and infrastructure. Kris is an engineer at heart and by background, and loves the leverage infrastructure innovation creates to accelerate technology and empower engineers to do their best work. A serial entrepreneur, Kris has founded and helped lead multiple other successful businesses in the internet and network infrastructure. Most recently, he co-founded and led NS1, which was acquired by IBM in 2023. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and is based in New Jersey.</p><p>~~~~~~~~ ✌️Connect With Us ✌️ ~~~~~~~</p><p>[00:00] Observability and Delta Analysis</p><p>[00:26] New World Exploration</p><p>[04:06] Bottlenecks in AI Infrastructure</p><p>[13:37] Data Center Optimization Challenges</p><p>[19:58] Tech Stack Breakdown</p><p>[25:26] Data Center Design Principles</p><p>[31:32] Constraints and Automation in Design</p><p>[40:00] Complexity in Data Centers</p><p>[45:02] GPU Cloud Landscape</p><p>[50:24] Data Centers in Containers</p><p>[57:45] Observability Beyond Software</p><p>[1:04:43] Tighter Integrations vs NetBox</p>","contentLength":1983,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/114972764/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2026-1-3%2F417394904-44100-2-451b18cae6d3.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"SED News: Apple Bets on Gemini, Google’s AI Advantage, and the Talent Arms Race","url":"https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2026/02/03/sed-news-apple-bets-on-gemini-googles-ai-advantage-and-the-talent-arms-race/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sed-news-apple-bets-on-gemini-googles-ai-advantage-and-the-talent-arms-race","date":1770112831,"author":"SEDaily","guid":430,"unread":true,"content":"<p>SED News is a monthly podcast from Software Engineering Daily where hosts Gregor Vand and Sean Falconer unpack the biggest stories shaping software engineering, Silicon Valley, and the broader tech industry.</p><p>In this episode, they cover <a href=\"https://starlink.com/\">Starlink</a>’s rapid rollout of free, high-speed in-flight internet, <a href=\"https://www.tesla.com/\">Tesla</a>’s move to deprecate Autopilot in favor of full self-driving, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/\">Apple</a>’s reported decision to power Siri with <a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Google</a>’s Gemini models.

At its height in the 18th and 19th centuries, whaling was a global enterprise built on perilous voyages, long seasons at sea, and a fierce chase for oil and baleen that illuminated streets and homes and lubricated the industrial revolution. In doing so, obsessed nations like Britain, Norway and America hounded whale populations to the brink, decimating populations and altering marine ecosystems forever.&nbsp;</p><p>But it's important to remember that this industry also has a rich social history. Whaling sustained communities across the globe, providing work, culture and a crucial way of life for working people in coastal regions and on remote islands like Shetland off the coast of Scotland.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Dan heads to Dundee, once a hub of the whaling industry, to explore both the devastating ecological impact and the rich human story to give us a fuller understanding of the history of whaling. He speaks to the curators at the South Georgia Museum, Jayne Pierce and Helen Balfour, as well as Richard Sabin from the Natural History Museum and also one of Shetland's last remaining whalers, Gibby Fraser.&nbsp;</p><p>You can explore more at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whalersmemorybank.sgmuseum.gs/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://whalersmemorybank.sgmuseum.gs/</a>&nbsp;to read through testimonies from other whalers, see incredible archive images and learn more about whales in the Arctic and Antarctic.&nbsp;</p><p>Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore</p>","contentLength":1409,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/697ca97065c54ec919934339/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&sig=8V6HMTZXcJrANeg3vQ5Un-Wb20Aqv13is2tTc8k_MhE","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"State of AI in 2026: LLMs, Coding, Scaling Laws, China, Agents, GPUs, AGI | Lex Fridman Podcast #490","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV7WhVT270Q","date":1769898813,"author":"Lex Fridman","guid":680,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Nathan Lambert and Sebastian Raschka are machine learning researchers, engineers, and educators.
