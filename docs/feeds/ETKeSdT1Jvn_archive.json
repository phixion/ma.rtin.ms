These teams are compressing the design, build, deploy, operate, scale cycle of their infrastructures down to months, while managing massive footprints with lean teams. How? By applying modern intent-driven infrastructure automation principles to greenfield deployments. We'll explore how these teams carry design intent through to production, and how operating and automating around consistent infrastructure data is compressing \"time to first train\".</p><p>Kris Beevers is the Co-founder and CEO of NetBox Labs. NetBox is used by nearly every Neocloud and AI datacenter to manage their networks and infrastructure. Kris is an engineer at heart and by background, and loves the leverage infrastructure innovation creates to accelerate technology and empower engineers to do their best work. A serial entrepreneur, Kris has founded and helped lead multiple other successful businesses in the internet and network infrastructure. Most recently, he co-founded and led NS1, which was acquired by IBM in 2023.

At its height in the 18th and 19th centuries, whaling was a global enterprise built on perilous voyages, long seasons at sea, and a fierce chase for oil and baleen that illuminated streets and homes and lubricated the industrial revolution. In doing so, obsessed nations like Britain, Norway and America hounded whale populations to the brink, decimating populations and altering marine ecosystems forever.&nbsp;</p><p>But it's important to remember that this industry also has a rich social history. Whaling sustained communities across the globe, providing work, culture and a crucial way of life for working people in coastal regions and on remote islands like Shetland off the coast of Scotland.&nbsp;</p><p>In this episode, Dan heads to Dundee, once a hub of the whaling industry, to explore both the devastating ecological impact and the rich human story to give us a fuller understanding of the history of whaling.

This talk introduces an approach to AI infrastructure optimization through universal resource management that reshapes applications to run efficiently on any available hardware—CPUs, GPUs, or accelerators.We explore how code reshaping technology can unlock the untapped potential of enterprise computing infrastructure, enabling organizations to serve 2-3x more workloads while dramatically reducing dependency on scarce GPU resources. The presentation demonstrates why CPUs often outperform GPUs for memory-intensive AI workloads, offering superior cost-effectiveness and immediate availability without architectural complexity.// BioWilder Lopes is a second-time founder, developer, and research engineer focused on building practical infrastructure for developers. He is currently building Ogre.run, an AI agent designed to solve code reproducibility.Ogre enables developers to package source code into fully reproducible environments in seconds. Unlike traditional tools that require extensive manual setup, Ogre uses AI to analyze codebases and automatically generate the artifacts needed to make code run reliably on any machine. The result is faster development workflows and applications that work out of the box, anywhere.// Related LinksWebsite: <a href=\"https://ogre.run\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://ogre.run</a><a href=\"https://lopes.ai\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://lopes.ai</a><a href=\"https://substack.com/@wilderlopes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://substack.com/@wilderlopes</a><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferer\">https://youtu.be/YCWkUub5x8c?si=7RPKqRhu0Uf9LTql</a></p>","contentLength":1857,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/114281481/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2026-0-20%2F416480151-44100-2-965e300ad37c6.mp3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Joe Rogan Experience #2441 - Paul Rosolie","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoFniMSMj08","date":1768932017,"author":"PowerfulJRE","guid":665,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Paul Rosolie is a conservationist, filmmaker, author, and founder of Junglekeepers.
