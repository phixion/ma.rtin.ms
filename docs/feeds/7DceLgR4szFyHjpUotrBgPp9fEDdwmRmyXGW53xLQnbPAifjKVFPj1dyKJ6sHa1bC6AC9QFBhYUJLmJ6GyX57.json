I wanted to make this post here, since Discord has decided to force age assumptions via facial scan and ID verification upon normal people. I also want to say that I'm not associated with Stoat in any capacity. I'm just a new user and want to make others aware of this.</p><p>First off. Yes, there are other valid alternatives that I'll list as well that I'll list here with an explanation of why it didn't work for me.</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.teamspeak.com/en/\">Teamspeak</a>: Thanks but no thanks. Screen sharing and audio for voice is amazing, but it's not the one for me. UI feels scattered and confusing.</li><li><a href=\"https://matrix.org/\">Matrix</a>: Amazing choice. Very clean look, and audio is great. The biggest issue though, is getting normies to use it. It can be a bit confusing if you're looking for something to replace discord. It also feels very corporate. But do not sleep on this.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/\">WhatsApp</a>, <a href=\"https://signal.org/\">Signal</a>, <a href=\"https://telegram.org/\">Telegram</a>: Not applicable in my opinion. Extremely different use case. Signal is great. Telegram is alright. Don't use WhatsApp. :)</li></ol><p>I'm not here to judge the software that you use. Use whatever software fits you or your group/use case. I'm only making a post to help \"normies\" get away from discord. Admittedly, not a lot of them are going to be looking here. So please crosspost (if allowed) to help spread the word as much as possible. I also use void btw, so there might be some differences in steps such as file paths, but it should all be the same. If there is an issue, just leave a comment and we'll address it together.</p><p>With all the boilerplate out of the way: here is how you can use stoat on Linux.</p><p>Use the AUR. If you are not sure how to use the AUR, then you'll have to find out how. I will not be telling you here.</p><ol><li>Download the .zip necessary for your instance (if you're not sure whether x86 or arm, just choose x86).</li><li>Once you've downloaded that .zip file, just extract it as you would any .zip, and rename its folder to \"Stoat\" for simplicity.</li><li>Move that new folder you renamed to \"Stoat\" into <code>~/.local/share/applications/</code>.</li><li>In your terminal, run: <code>ls ~/.local/share/applications/Stoat/</code>. <ul><li>If you see output including a file named \"stoat-desktop\", great. You're doing awesome. Keep going.</li></ul></li><li>You'll need to create a desktop entry. So, create a file named \"stoat.desktop\" and open it in your favorite text editor. Follow this template:</li></ol><pre><code>[Desktop Entry] Name=Stoat GenericName=Stoat Exec=\"~/.local/share/applications/share/Stoat/stoat-desktop/\" Type=Application Categories=AudioVideo;Network; Icon=/path/to/icon </code></pre><ul><li>Lastly, we just need to move the  file we created to  so that it can be found by your launcher/menu. I would just recommend by opening the folder in a terminal and using the  command: <code>sudo mv ./stoat.desktop /usr/share/applications</code>.</li></ul><p>Once that is done, you should be done. Enjoy stoat at your leisure. It's going to have a generic icon if you haven't appointed an icon to it. Luckily for you, I've made some simple icons to fix that for you. They're on my GitHub. You're more than welcome to use them. <a href=\"https://github.com/dclmao/stoat-icon/\">https://github.com/dclmao/stoat-icon</a>.</p>","contentLength":2981,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Vim 9.2 Released With Experimental Wayland Support, Better HiDPI Display Support","url":"https://www.phoronix.com/news/Vim-9.2-Released","date":1771119071,"author":"/u/anh0516","guid":327,"unread":true,"content":"<p>Michael Larabel is the principal author of Phoronix.com and founded the site in 2004 with a focus on enriching the Linux hardware experience.
