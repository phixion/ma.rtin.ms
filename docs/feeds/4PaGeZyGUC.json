Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n \nIf you have a tip, feel free to contact DW's investigative unit here: https://www.dw.com/en/do-you-have-confidential-information-that-you-want-to-share-with-dw/a-61899300\n\n#documentary #investigation #reporter #dwstories #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Bring up the railguns, let‚Äôs finish this and go home.‚Äô - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015\n\nElectromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.\n\nThe lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.\n\nThis will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852).

When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick‚Äôs crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.\n\nIn this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy?

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.\n\nThe young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin‚Äôs high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.\n\nJustin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.\n\nConor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he‚Äôs running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.\n\nDespite the government‚Äôs promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ireland  #housing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

People also began to question the price they had paid for efforts made at protecting themselves and others against this virus. \n\nWhat impact did the coronavirus pandemic have on our life?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":1212,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QkYaMcaT-zg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The century-old technology that could change the world - Rachel Yang","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-T0PEWRaVc","date":1741705304,"author":"TED-Ed","guid":111,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Dig into the science of thermal batteries, and how this technology can generate heat more efficiently than fossil fuels.\n\n--\n\nIndustrial manufacturers spend a huge amount of energy generating heat to make everyday materials and objects, like cement, steel, and paper.

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It‚Äôs often a long way to travel to see a doctor, and treatment is expensive. But an organization from Germany is providing those affected with orthopedic aids, as well as training specialists.\n\nIn Uganda, people with disabilities not only often live in great poverty, there‚Äôs also hardly any medical care available to them. For more than 10 years now, an organization from Usingen in the German state of Hesse has been providing people with prostheses and other orthopedic aids. In the small town of Kiyunga near the capital Kampala, ProUganda has set up a center with a modern orthopedic workshop and treatment rooms.\nBut not everyone can get there: The roads are uneven and it‚Äôs difficult for poor families to get to Kiyunga with their children. That‚Äôs why the team travels to rural areas in minibuses. In the trunk: wheelchairs, some delivered second-hand from Germany, some bought with donations.\nThe film accompanies members of the aid organization as they work with patients in Kiyunga, in the workshop and on missions in the region.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #uganda #medical #africa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.
