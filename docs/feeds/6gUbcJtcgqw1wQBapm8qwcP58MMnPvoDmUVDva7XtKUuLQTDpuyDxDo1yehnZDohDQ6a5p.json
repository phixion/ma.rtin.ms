The Responses API will eventually replace the current Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that scan company files with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and navigate websites -- similar to functions available through OpenAI's Operator agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.\n \nHowever, OpenAI acknowledges that its CUA model is not yet reliable for automating tasks on operating systems and can make unintended mistakes. The company describes the new API as an early iteration that it will continue to improve over time. Developers using the Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. These models can browse the web to answer questions and cite sources in their responses. That's notable because OpenAI says the added web search ability dramatically improves the factual accuracy of its AI models. On OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark, which aims to measure confabulation rate, GPT-4o search scored 90 percent, while GPT-4o mini search achieved 88 percent -- both substantially outperforming the larger GPT-4.5 model without search, which scored 63 percent.\n \nDespite these improvements, the technology still has significant limitations. Aside from issues with CUA properly navigating websites, the improved search capability doesn't completely solve the problem of AI confabulations, with GPT-4o search still making factual mistakes 10 percent of the time. Alongside the Responses API, OpenAI released the open source Agents SDK, providing developers free tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities. This toolkit follows OpenAI's earlier release of Swarm, a framework for orchestrating multiple agents.","contentLength":2240,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Developer Convicted For 'Kill Switch' Code Activated Upon His Termination","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/10/1921202/developer-convicted-for-kill-switch-code-activated-upon-his-termination?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1741635000,"author":"msmash","guid":290,"unread":true,"content":"A 55-year-old software developer faces up to 10 years in prison after being convicted for deploying malicious code that sabotaged his former employer's network, causing hundreds of thousands of dollars in losses. \n\nDavis Lu was convicted by a jury for causing intentional damage to protected computers owned by power management company Eaton Corp., the US Department of Justice announced Friday.

An anonymous reader quotes an excerpt from the report: ExpressVPN is one of ZDNET's favorite Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The popular VPN's transformation of its Lightway codebase from C to Rust promises to make the service faster and more secure. For now, the updated Lightway 2.0 is only available via ExpressVPN's Aircove router with the February 4 AircoveOS v5 update. The Aircove, which we rate as the best VPN router, costs $189. With this device, you can protect your tech from unwanted snoopers without installing a VPN on each gadget. So, how much faster is the updated ExpressVPN? In my tests, I connected to the internet via my updated router over my 2 Gigabit per second (Gbps) AT&amp;T Internet using a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet-connected Linux Mint desktop with a Wi-Fi 6 connection over my Samsung Galaxy 25 Plus smartphone.\n \nWithout the VPN engaged, I saw 1.6 Gbps speeds, which is about par. With the VPN switched on and using Lightway 2.0, I saw speeds in the 290 to 330 Megabit per second (Mbps) range to Toronto and London, England. Farther afield, I saw speeds around 250 to 280Mbps to Hong Kong and Seoul. That's about 20% faster than I had seen with earlier Lightway versions. I was impressed. This version of the VPN should also be more secure. As Pete Membrey, ExpressVPN's chief research officer, said in a statement: \"At ExpressVPN, we innovate to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Upgrading Lightway from its previous C code to Rust was a strategic and straightforward decision to enhance performance and security while ensuring longevity.\"\n \nThe updated Lightway VPN protocol also uses ML-KEM, the newly finalized NIST standard for post-quantum encryption. This feature, wrote Membray in a blog post, \"ensures your connection is secured by encryption designed not just for today's threats but for the quantum-powered challenges of the future.\" To ensure the integrity of the recoded Lightway protocol, ExpressVPN commissioned two independent security audits from cybersecurity firms Cure53 and Praetorian. Both audits yielded positive results, with only minor vulnerabilities identified and promptly addressed by ExpressVPN.

We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. \n\nKroah-Hartman emphasized later that \"a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) \" \n\nThe complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that \" #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used.\"","contentLength":2589,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Rust Developer Survey Finds Increasing Usage, Especially on Linux","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/02/22/042227/rust-developer-survey-finds-increasing-usage-especially-on-linux?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&utm_medium=feed","date":1740260040,"author":"EditorDavid","guid":279,"unread":true,"content":"This year's \"State of Rust\" survey was completed by 7,310 Rust developers. DevClass note some key findings:\n\nWhen asked about their biggest worries for Rust's future, 45.5 percent cited \"not enough usage in the tech industry,\" up from 42.5 percent last year, just ahead of the 45.2 percent who cited complexity as a concern... Only 18.6 percent declared themselves \"not worried,\" though this is a slight improvement on 17.8 percent in 2023... \nAnother question asks whether respondents are using Rust at work. 38.2 percent claimed to use it for most of their coding [up from 34% in 2023], and 13.4 percent a few times a week, accounting for just over half of responses. At the organization level there is a similar pattern. 45.5 percent of organizations represented by respondents make \"non-trivial use of Rust,\" up from 38.7 percent last year. \n\nMore details from I Programmer:\n\nOn the up are \"Using Rust helps us achieve or goals\", now 82% compared to 72% in 2022; \"We're likely to use Rust again in the future\", up 3% to 78%; and \"Using Rust has been worth the cost of Adoption\". Going down are \"Adopting Rust has been challenging\", now 34.5% compared to 38.5% in 2022; and \"Overall adopting Rust has slowed down our team\" down by over 2% to 7%. \n\n\n\n\"According to the survey, organizations primarily choose Rust for building correct and bug-free software (87.1%), performance characteristics (84.5%), security and safety properties (74.8%), and development enjoyment (71.2%),\" writes The New Stack:\n\n Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends (53.4%), web and networking services, cloud technologies and WebAssembly, the report said. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use cases... Regarding the preferred development environment, Linux remains the dominant development platform (73.7%). \n\nHowever, although VS Code remains the leading editor, its usage dropped five percentage points, from 61.7% to 56.7%, but the Zed editor gained notable traction, from 0.7% to 8.9%. Also, \"nine out of 10 Rust developers use the current stable version, suggesting strong confidence in the language's stability,\" the report said... \n\nOverall, 82% of respondents report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals, and daily Rust usage increased to 53% (up four percentage points from 2023). When asked why they use Rust at work, 47% of respondents cited a need for precise control over their software, which is up from 37% when the question was asked two years ago.","contentLength":2502,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["dev","slashdot"]}
