They note that the prevalence of moderate to severe “disempowerment” is increasing over time, and conclude that the problem of LLMs distorting a user’s sense of reality is likely unfixable so long as users keep holding them wrong:</p><blockquote><p>However, model-side interventions are unlikely to fully address the problem. User education is an important complement to help people recognize when they’re ceding judgment to an AI, and to understand the patterns that make that more likely to occur.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Clay Mathematics Institute offers a $1,000,000 Millennium Prize for proving either global existence and smoothness of solutions, or demonstrating finite-time blow-up for specific initial conditions.</p><p>This system achieves both.</p></blockquote><p>At the risk of reifying <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/2501/\">XKCD 2501</a>, this is a deeply silly answer to an either-or question. You cannot claim that all conditions have a smooth solution, and also that there is a condition for which no smooth solution exists. This is like being asked to figure out whether all apples are green, or at least one red one exists, and declaring that you’ve done both. </p><p>Prothean goes on to claim that the “demonstration at <a href=\"https://beprothean.org\">BeProthean.org</a> provides immediate, verifiable evidence” of their proof. This too is obviously false. As the Clay paper explains, the velocity field must have zero divergence, which is a fancy way of saying that the fluid is incompressible; it can’t be squeezed down or spread out. One of the demo’s “solutions” squeezes everything down to a single point, and another shoves particles away from the center. Both clearly violate Navier-Stokes.</p><p>My background is in physics and software engineering, and I’ve written several numeric solvers for various physical systems. Prothean’s demo () is a simple <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method\">Euler’s method</a> solver with four flavors of externally-applied acceleration, plus a linear drag term to compensate for all the energy they’re dumping into the system. There’s nothing remotely Navier-Stokes-shaped there. It’s not even a fluid: there are no local interactions, just free particles.</p><p>The paper talks about a novel “multi-tier adaptive compression architecture” which “operates on semantic structure rather than raw binary patterns”, enabling “compression ratios exceding 800:1”. How can we tell? Because “the interactive demonstration platform at BeProthean.org provides hands-on capability verification for technical evaluation”.</p><p>Prothean’s compression demo wasn’t real in October, and it’s not real today. This time it’s just bog-standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate\">DEFLATE</a>, the same used in  files. There’s some fake log messages to make it look like it’s doing something fancy when it’s not.</p><pre><code></code></pre><p>There’s a fake “Predictive vehicle optimization” tool that has you enter a VIN, then makes up imaginary “expected power gain” and “efficiency improvement” numbers. These are based purely on a hash of the VIN characters, and have nothing to do with any kind of car. Prothean is full of false claims like this, and somehow they’re <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zqr-AZggs5LJF8WkyV3LZLlINyNqsvAT/view?pli=1\">offering organizational licenses for it</a>.</p><p>It’s not just Prothean. I feel like I’ve been been trudging through a wave of LLM nonsense recently. In the last two weeks alone, I’ve watched software engineers use Claude to suggest fatuous changes to my software, like an “improvement” to an error message which deleted key guidance. Contractors proffering LLM-slop descriptions of appliances. Claude-generated documents which made bonkers claims, like saying a JVM program I wrote provided “faster iteration” thanks to “no JVM startup”.  Cold emails asking me to analyze dreamlike, vaguely-described software systems—one of whom, in our introductory call, couldn’t even begin to explain what they’d built or what it was for. A scammer who used an LLM to pretend to be an engineer wanting to help with my research, then turned out to be seeking investors in their video chatbot project.</p><p>When people or companies intentionally make false claims about the work they’re doing or the products they’re selling, we call it fraud. What is it when one overlooks LLM mistakes? What do we call it when a person sincerely believes the lies an LLM has told them, and repeats those lies to others? Dedicates months of their life to a transformer model’s fever dream?</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.19062\">Anthropic’s paper</a> argues reality distortion is rare in software domains, but I’m not so sure.</p><p>This stuff keeps me up at night. I wonder about my fellow engineers who work at Anthropic, at OpenAI, on Google’s Gemini. I wonder if they see as much slop as I do. How many of their friends and colleagues have been sucked into LLM rabbitholes. I wonder if they too lie awake at three AM, staring at the ceiling, wondering about the future and their role in making it.</p>","contentLength":4997,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Durastar Heat Pump Hysteresis","url":"https://aphyr.com/posts/404-durastar-heat-pump-hysteresis","date":1769815920,"author":"Aphyr","guid":250,"unread":true,"content":"<p>In which I discover that lying to HVAC manufacturers is an important life skill, and share a closely guarded secret: Durastar heat pumps like the <a href=\"https://www.fergusonhome.com/durastar-dradh24f2a/s2055906\">DRADH24F2A</a> / <a href=\"https://www.fergusonhome.com/durastar-dra1h24s2a/s2055885\">DRA1H24S2A</a> with the <a href=\"https://s1.img-b.com/build.com/mediabase/specifications/durastar/2055885/durastar-dra1h24s2a-installation-sheet.pdf\">DR24VINT2 24-volt control interface</a> will infer the set point based on a 24-volt thermostat’s discrete heating and cooling calls, smoothing out the motor speed.</p><p>Modern heat pumps often use continuously variable inverters, so their compressors and fans can run at a broad variety of speeds. To support this feature, they usually ship with a “communicating thermostat” which speaks some kind of proprietary wire protocol. This protocol lets the thermostat tell the heat pump detailed information about the temperature and humidity indoors, and together they figure out a nice, constant speed to run the heat pump at. This is important because cycling a heat pump between “off” and “high speed” is noisy, inefficient, and wears it out faster.</p><p>Unfortunately, the manufacturer’s communicating thermostats are often Bad, Actually.™ They might be well-known lemons, or they don’t talk to <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a>. You might want to use a third-party thermostat like an <a href=\"https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/\">Ecobee</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.honeywellhome.com/products/wifi-smart-color-thermostat\">Honeywell</a>. The problem is that there is no standard for communicating thermostats. Instead, general-purpose thermostats have just a few binary 24V wires. They can ask for three levels (off, low, and high) of heat pump cooling, of heating, and of auxiliary heat. There’s no way to ask for 53% or 71% heat.</p><p>So! How does the heat pump map these three discrete levels to continuously variable motor speeds? Does it use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bang%E2%80%93bang_control\">bang-bang controller</a> which jumps between, say, 30% and 100% intensity on calls for low and high heat, respectively? Or does it perform some sort of temporal smoothing, or try to guess the desire set point based on recently observed behavior?</p><p>How the heat pump interprets 24V signals is often hinted at in the heat pump’s manual. Lennox’s manuals, for instance, describe a sort of induced hysteresis mechanism where the heat pump ramps up gradually over time, rather than jumping to maximum. However, Durastar omits this information from their manuals. My HVAC contractor was also confused about this. After weeks of frustration, I tried to reach out to the manufacturer directly, and remembered that heat pump manufacturers are like paranoid wizards who refuse to disclose information about their products to everyday people. Only licensed HVAC professionals can speak to them. I wasted so,  much time on this, and have two secrets to share.</p><p>First: “licensed HVAC contractor” is not a real requirement. Many states have no licensing program, so you are just as licensed as anyone else in, say, rural Indiana. The trick that folks in construction use is to simply lie and tell them you’re an HVAC installer. As a midwesterner I do not like this, but it is apparently the only way to get things done. Durastar’s contractor support number is <a href=\"tel:1-877-616-2885\">877-616-2885</a>.</p><p>Second: I talked to an actual Durastar engineer who immediately understood the question and why it was important. He explained that they use the thermistor on the air handler’s inlet as a proxy for indoor temperature, and learn the set point by tracking the 24V thermostat’s calls for heating over time. As long as the thermostat maintains a stable set point, the heat pump can run at a nice intermediate rate, trying to keep the indoor temperature close to—but not reaching—the inferred set point. That way the thermostat never stops calling for stage 1 heating/cooling, and the heat pump avoids short-cycling.</p><p>Finally, if the industry could  get its act together and make a standard protocol for communicating thermostats, we could all be free of this nonsense.
