The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. \n\nUntil the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act ‚Äì as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  \n\nWhile pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU. \n\nWatch the full documentary ‚ÄúTransnistria: Caught between Russia and the EU‚Äù on the DW Documentary YouTube channel. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #Russia #Moldova #Transnistria #EU  \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

It‚Äòs one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.\n\nThe soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. \nThe 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e R√©giment √âtranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. \nThe fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the \"Harpie mission\". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.\nA second mission in French Guiana is called \"Titan\". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  \nAt the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entra√Ænement en for√™t √©quatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #rainforest #foreignlegion \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.\n\nThey delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 A 19-year journey from Java 5 to Java 25\n04:41 The shift toward immutability &amp; unmodifiable collections\n07:08 Usage guidance: Ownership &amp; the anemic domain model\n17:58 Extension points &amp; the fragile base class problem\n20:41 Design retrospective: The unsupported operation exception controversy\n27:11 The Null handling mess\n29:09 A lasting achievement\n30:21 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 2nd ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/47dOp9t\nMaurice Naftalin &amp; Philip Wadler ‚Ä¢ Java Generics and Collections 1st ed ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/42JI03i\nJoshua Bloch ‚Ä¢ Effective Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oFbdoi\nVictor Grazi &amp; Jeanne Boyarsky ‚Ä¢ Real-World Java ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4oCEeBR\nKevlin Henney &amp; Trisha Gee ‚Ä¢ 97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3kiTwJJ\nChristian Clausen ‚Ä¢ Five Lines of Code ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3s2zjyg\nNicolai Parlog ‚Ä¢ The Java Module System ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3xFggR4\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#Java #JavaGenerics #JavaCollections #Immutability #Unmodifiability #Encapsulation #Java25 #Java5 #Null #NullHandling #Getters #Setters #AnemicDomainModel #JavaProgramming #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #MauriceNaftalin #StuartMarks #PhilipWadler #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Richard Sorge fought against Hitler and National Socialism. Out of conviction for the Communist cause, Richard Sorge acted as a spy in service of Stalin. The man with a German father and a Russian mother was a member of Hitler's NSDAP and was living in Japan, an ally of Nazi-Germany. In 1951 a journalist wrote that, \"He had indeed betrayed his fatherland, but in favour of his motherland.\" And truer words have never been spoken. He was a master spy, duty-bound to the fight against Hitler - a daredevil, a womanizer and a rule breaker. Richard Sorge is not just the model for Ian Fleming's \"James Bond\" - he was the actual James Bond - a fact that turns this historical documentary into a cinematic thriller. \n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended ‚ÄúJimmy Kimmel Live!‚Äù \n\nKimmel‚Äôs suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC‚Äôs actions left many questioning whether Kimmel‚Äôs First Amendment rights were violated.\n\nThis incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the ‚Äúinalienable right‚Äù to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  \n\nWith 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  \n\nBut they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.\n\nStudies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone ‚Äî and could it actually be preferable?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #smartphones #kids #socialmedia \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, with co-host Matt Kirshen and ‚ÄúGeek-in-Chief‚Äù Charles Liu, takes a look at the monsters that have terrified us, like the zombies in The Last of Us or Godzilla, and the scary speculative science behind them. Are black holes cosmic cookie monsters?\n\nCharles shares his favorite creature, Godzilla, as Japan‚Äôs way of processing nuclear trauma. What does it mean that the monster came from radiation? Neil recalls his childhood fascination with Rodan‚Äôs supersonic flight and asks: could any creature that big actually move? We put monster physics to the test. What would happen if Godzilla really walked the Earth? Would his bones shatter under his own weight?\n\nFrom King Kong‚Äôs tragic fall to Frankenstein‚Äôs electric creation, we trace how monsters evolved alongside scientific discovery. How did Benjamin Franklin‚Äôs experiments with electricity inspire Mary Shelley? Why are we drawn to the undead like zombies in The Last of Us to infected humans in Body Snatchers? Could climate change or fungi actually create a real-life zombie apocalypse?\n\nAnd what if the scariest monsters‚Ä¶ are humans themselves? From Finding Nemo to The Twilight Zone, Neil, Matt, and Charles examine how fear of the unfamiliar drives us to monstrous behavior.

Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.\n\nFlavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.\n\nThe twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed.

She can no longer breathe freely. A donor organ is finally found. The film shows the beginning of her new life. Her struggle, her happiness, and her setbacks.\n\nRuth Bopp will never forget October 20, 2023. At 3:50 a.m., the ringing of her cell phone roused her from sleep. On the other end of the line: Hannover Medical School. The news: there was a suitable lung for her. An ambulance was already on its way.\nRuth Bopp suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, a serious chronic disease that makes breathing increasingly difficult. For years, she was dependent on an oxygen tank. After the transplant, she was able to breathe freely again just four days later - without a tube or device. \"It was an indescribable feeling,‚Äù she says. \"Finally being able to breathe on my own again - that was wonderful.‚Äù\nBut Ruth's story is an exception. In Germany, 8,400 patients are urgently waiting for a donor organ - but there are only 965 donors. The country has what‚Äôs known as an \"opt-in‚Äù policy: organ or tissue donation is only possible if the deceased person has given their consent during their lifetime - or if their relatives do so retroactively. In many other European countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands, however, an \"opt-out‚Äù policy applies: anyone who does not expressly object is automatically considered a donor.\nThe documentary provides an insight into what life with a serious lung disease is like, and traces the path to transplantation. The film also documents the emotional power of hope. Ruth Bopp makes an urgent appeal to society: \"If you need an organ yourself, you want it straight away - but very few people consider the idea of donating themselves.‚Äù Yet current surveys show a positive trend: according to a study by one medical insurance group, 49% of adults in Germany now have an organ donor card - compared to 41% in 2021.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #organdonation #donors \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

One that is deployed against men, as well as women. The enemy is not killed, but destroyed nonetheless. In this documentary, men from Ukraine, Congo and Bosnia break their silence.\n\nMost male survivors of sexual violence remain silent. So the perpetrators get away with it. Often, the perpetrators do not even have a sense of wrongdoing when they commit these war crimes.\n\nThe first men to seek justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague were survivors of the Bosnian War (1992-1995). This marked a turning point.\n\nZihnija Ba≈°iƒá from Bosnia tells how he had to fight for a long time to be recognized as a war victim after his rapes. He still suffers from the abuse to this day. Oleksiy Sivak from Ukraine has since founded a self-help group. Like his friend Roman Shapovalenko, he was sexually abused by Russian occupying forces. \n\nMasokolo Lemba from the Congo is also a member of a self-help group. Lemba fled from the war in his home country to Uganda - where survivors of sexual violence are often accused of homosexuality, which is a punishable offense in Uganda. This stigmatization and criminalization make it difficult to cope with the trauma. \n\nHistorian Regina M√ºhlh√§user is a member of an international research group that investigates sexual violence against men. She says: \"If you want to prevent sexual violence against men in war-time, you have to fight it in peace-time. After all, prisons and the military are often breeding grounds for this violence.\"\n\nDespite their fear of stigmatization and discrimination, the survivors in this film have chosen to tell their stories in order to bring this taboo topic to light.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #war \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary \nO‚ÄôReilly sit down with neuroscientist Ben Rein, author of Why Brains Need Friends: The Science of Social Connection, to explore how the loneliness epidemic impacts our minds, bodies, and even our lifespan.\n\nWhat‚Äôs the difference between being alone and being lonely? Why can you be surrounded by people and still feel alone? We breaks down the neurobiology behind social connection, how oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine reward our interactions, and what happens when we‚Äôre missing those signals. From rising cortisol levels to chronic inflammation, we learn how prolonged loneliness can actually damage organs and shorten lives.\n\nDo extroverts live longer? How much social time is ‚Äúenough‚Äù? We dig into personality, empathy, and why virtual interactions often leave us unsatisfied. Could our brains be losing their ability to read social cues online‚Äîand is that fueling the hostility of the internet age?\n\nCan we medicate loneliness away? How do drugs like MDMA affect empathy? We get into why oxytocin is nature‚Äôs antidepressant, and how our pets might literally make us healthier. We get into research on what makes for good socializing and how loneliness leads to more loneliness. How do we dig ourselves out?\n\nThanks to our Patrons kendrick bell, edthri, Patrick Canada, Robert Reyes, Rob, Link and \nZelda, sweetheat223, Austin Liu, k, Brian Crimmins, Dominic Miller, Thomas Hammer, Tanuj \nKhandelwal, Adam Bukowski, Gavin Jones-Verity, Powell Houser, Paul Westenheffer, Diego \nEscamilla Quintana, Mark Johnston, Sam Richie, Kate Bornstein, Terry, Roger Craig, Lawrence \nSansevere, Paul Medrano, Maaz Gundagi, Ken Dodge, Bob Wilson, Airshipguy, Adam Omelan, \nJoseph Jones, Athena Conkins, Peter Keller, Keitumetse Tlokana, The Clacken, Kris Fisher, \nJonathan, Tamos Memes, Jesse Krist, Stephanie Thorsen, Scanman, Samuel Steffen, \nTheEvilSensei, Amporn Rabuenam, Danielle, James Gill, D.

Rapper JQueen channels her anger into powerful rap songs as a solo artist or with her all-female band ‚ÄúWild Wild Women.‚Äù And student Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu campaigns to get more women to enter politics. They all represent a new generation pushing back against traditional gender roles. They demand respect and personal safety despite structural barriers and societal expectations. Their resistance shows that change begins at the point where women empower themselves.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:55 Passionate and unrelenting: Usha Vishwakarma \n03:12 Self-defense training with the Red Brigade \n04:21 Male voices: Contradictions and culture \n05:28 Training schoolgirls to fight back \n07:09 Village conversations \n09:21 Feminist author Meghna Pant‚Äôs perspective \n11:03 JQueen: Rap as rebellion \n12:47 Family, judgment and societal expectations \n15:10 Women‚Äôs safety in public \n16:20 Meghna‚Äôs story: Abuse and escape \n17:18 Politics and impunity \n18:27 Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu: A quiet rebellion \n21:15 Visibility and education as tools of change \n24:07 Tradition vs. transformation \n25:40 Conclusion: Where do we go from here?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #dwstories #india \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

To what extent are Russian interests present within American foreign policy? And - could there be a connection between the answers to these two questions?\n\nUS President Donald Trump has had ties to Russia for decades. In this documentary, former KGB, FBI and CIA employees offer insights into the world of espionage, the Cold War and Trump's extensive network of connections to Russia.\n\nDuring the Cold War, numerous Russian agents infiltrated a variety of political and economic organizations in the US. In addition to industrial espionage, the missions also focused on establishing relationships with influential political figures.\n\nTrump's ties to Russia date back to this period. In 1987, he traveled to Moscow with his then-wife, Ivana, to negotiate a deal to build a luxury hotel there. Semion Mogilevich, head of the Russian mafia, was one of the first investors in New York's Trump Tower. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump was simultaneously pursuing plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. \n\nInvestigations into possible Kremlin interference in the presidential election reveal that more than a dozen members of the Republican campaign team had ties to Russia. And the war against Ukraine further complicates the situation: Russian President Vladimir Putin would have a keen interest in an ally who could weaken Ukraine and help him win.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #russia #usa #trump \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The discussion with Kief Morris explores the practical definition of DevOps as efficient software delivery methodology, the relationship between infrastructure as code and application orchestration tools, the necessity of frameworks over custom wrapper scripts, and emerging paradigms including infrastructure from code, infrastructure as graph models, and interactive runbooks.\n\nJim emphasizes that while new approaches are interesting, maturity and standardization in existing tools often provides more value than constantly chasing new technologies.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:10 The LinkedIn transformation\n04:29 Defining DevOps\n06:43 Platform engineering &amp; the infrastructure stack\n20:21 The framework question\n28:17 The future of infrastructure as code\n36:52 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nYevgeniy Brikman ‚Ä¢ Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3WMPMFU\nYevgeniy Brikman ‚Ä¢ Terraform: Up and Running ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4otpxQL\nYevgeniy Brikman ‚Ä¢ Hello, Startup ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3JmV0VR\nKief Morris ‚Ä¢ Infrastructure as Code ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/4e6EBQc\nMauricio Salatino ‚Ä¢ Platform Engineering on Kubernetes ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3X14qZK\nCharity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones &amp; George Miranda ‚Ä¢ Observability Engineering ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/38scbma\n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#DevOps #SoftwareDelivery #InfrastructureAsCode #Infrastructure #Terraform #Kubernetes #Terragrunt #OpenTofu #Pulumi #CICD #YAML #TodayInTech #SoftwareDevelopment #SoftwareEngineering #Programming #Abstraction #YevgeniyBrikman #JimBrikman #KiefMorris #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

It permeates the air, soil, and even our bodies. The problem is getting worse, and yet the plastics industry is increasing production.\n\nEnvironmental lawyer Steven Feit reveals that plastics are the petroleum industry‚Äôs growth strategy in the 21st century, even as the world moves away from fossil fuels as an energy source. Sarah Jeanne Royer, an oceanographer, shows the damage microplastics are doing to the coasts of Hawaii. Sharon Lavigne, a retired teacher, fights against pollution and environmental racism in her city, which is home to some of the largest plastic production facilities in the US. The film also follows a photojournalist raising awareness about the problems being caused by single-use plastics in his native Kenya, and lobbyists who aim to convince the industry‚Äôs critics that new recycling technologies will make a difference. And one Hamburg-based chemist and inventor has suggestions for how we could solve the world‚Äôs plastics problem once and for all.\n\nIs the plastics industry listening? Can people trust it to take responsibility for plastic products after the end of their life cycle? And what solutions are there in a world that is increasingly choking on plastic?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #plastic #environment \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

As engineers and technicians, we have been building and operating some of the most complex systems on Earth and beyond for centuries. However, when we encounter modern cloud applications that serve us in our daily lives, we often find ourselves complaining that they are complicated. We label the communication lines in distributed systems as complex.\n\nWhy is that? Are we losing our ingenuity in dealing with modern applications?\n\nThis talk will explore the complexities of modern systems and help you understand the various types of complexity, both beneficial and detrimental. It will also provide strategies for effectively managing complexity while building cloud and serverless applications.

Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\n‚ÄúThe Rise of RFK Jr.‚Äùoffers a powerful portrait of how President Donald Trump‚Äôs Secretary of Health and Human Services became who he is today ‚Äî starting with his childhood in the public eye as a nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy.\n\nThe two-hour documentary draws on rich archival footage and two dozen interviews that include Kennedy‚Äôs lifelong friends, his cousin, top political advisors, close allies in the anti-vaccine movement, scientists he has clashed with, and some he has pushed out of the government. The film is a revelatory examination of Kennedy‚Äôs life ‚Äî his darkest moments, his triumphs, and the influence he‚Äôs now exerting as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n‚ÄúIf he continues in the current approach, it will make decisions to get vaccinated more difficult. As you see an erosion of people‚Äôs trust, you‚Äôll see the numbers of people getting vaccinated going down, and you‚Äôll start to see the numbers of illnesses coming back up,‚Äù says Dr. Daniel Jernigan, one of several top CDC officials who resigned under Kennedy and speaks out in the film. ‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs an awful thing to think about in a country that has put so much into protecting Americans with vaccines so far.‚Äù\n\nBut Kennedy‚Äôs die-hard supporters, especially from the anti-vaccine movement, insist he is bringing welcome changes to America‚Äôs health system.  \n\n‚ÄúHe‚Äôs trying to triage the worst health situation this country has ever found itself in,‚Äù says Del Bigtree, a podcaster, vaccine critic and a close friend of Kennedy. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have time to have disagreement around you. Get someone in here who agrees with where we‚Äôre going, and let‚Äôs do this.‚Äù \n\nTimely and gripping, ‚ÄúThe Rise of RFK Jr.‚Äù is a must-watch documentary on one of the most prominent and controversial people in U.S. politics right now, and his impact on the country. \n\n‚ÄúThe Rise of RFK Jr.‚Äù is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd.

Several yachts were so badly damaged that they sank. But what‚Äôs behind the animals‚Äô behavior?\n\nOrcas, also known as killer whales, compete with fishers around the globe for tuna. Until five years ago, there had never been any reports of attacks on boats. But since then, there have been repeated reports of the creatures ramming yachts, particularly in summer and spring. The orcas mostly target the rudders of the sailboats. The main focal point of the \"interactions,‚Äù as marine biologists refer to them, occur in the Strait of Gibraltar and off Portugal‚Äôs Atlantic Coast. Fishers, residents, whale watchers and researchers are puzzled by their sudden aggressive behavior. \nVarious theories have been put forward. Some think it might be linked to competition over tuna, which migrate from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to spawn in May before returning in July. Others suspect that it is some kind of revenge action for past injuries incurred. An older female, the leader of an orca pod, allegedly had bad experiences with boats and is teaching pod members to fight back. Many marine biologists believe it is just a kind of game. What is certain is that no one has actually been seriously hurt up to now ‚Äî not even on the yachts that sank, which begs the question: Are humans even the main target?  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #orca #whale \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The ERA would embed protection from gender-based discrimination and enshrine bodily autonomy in the Constitution. Follow a cross-generational, cross-party movement, led by Black women and fueled by grassroots power, to push the ERA over the finish line and into the Constitution.\n\nThe film follows organizing efforts as a cross-party coalition confronts entrenched political power.

She was one of hundreds of what now referred to as 'wolf children,' who fought to survive without their parents, all alone in East Prussia and the Baltics. The mass exodus from East Prussia deeply affected children. In northern East Prussia, around K√∂nigsberg, tens of thousands of people died from disease and malnutrition. Often, the children were left behind. But without their parents, any relatives, or homes, they were had to fend for themselves. Many fled from impending starvation by crossing into neighboring Lithuania, where they begged or worked for bread and other bare necessities. For decades, their stories went unrecognized.

Through patterns like the \"solo coding event\", \"everything but the kitchen sink\" and \"space abuse\" she demonstrates how human behaviors, organizational dynamics, career frameworks, and company processes leave traces in codebases that no one intentionally designed.\n\nVanessa argues that technical leaders must look beyond pure technical excellence to understand the organic system they're working within, advocating for honest conversations about constraints and realistic architectural decisions that account for human factors.\nThe discussion extends to the emerging need for ethical engineering as our technical decisions increasingly impact society at unprecedented speed, with practical advice for teams to analyze their own systems through the lens of tech, people, and product dimensions.\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n01:19 What is Holistic Engineering?\n06:28 Patterns in the wild\n09:31 The domain library problem\n11:58 The gap between theory &amp; practice\n13:34 Taking a broader view: The challenge of organizational forces\n15:17 Recognizing the slippery slope\n18:13 Strategies for recognition &amp; mitigation\n26:55 Starting small: Team-level analysis\n33:51 The future: Ethical engineering &amp; changing technology\n36:50 Code as a mirror\n38:11 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nAndrew Harmel-Law ‚Ä¢ Facilitating Software Architecture ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.eu/d/5kZKVfU\nAdam Tornhill ‚Ä¢ Your Code as a Crime Scene ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3FI5E2V\nChristopher Alexander ‚Ä¢ A Pattern Language ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3Urefj3\nDiana Montalion ‚Ä¢ Learning Systems Thinking ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3ZpycdJ\nDonella H.

That means climbing 3,000 meters in altitude, all while crossing rivers and a glacier. Called \"transhumance,‚Äù the seasonal movement of livestock is now world cultural heritage.\n\nAlong with 1,400 sheep, shepherd Markus and his colleagues travel from South Tyrol to Austria every spring, journeying back again in the fall. Just like his ancestors, Markus looks after the animals on the mountain pastures throughout the summer. It‚Äôs an arduous task, but also a dream job.\n\nMarkus is also responsible for ensuring that the crossing of the Alps runs smoothly again this year. This is no easy feat, as the route over rockfall and ice is dangerous for animals and humans alike. Accidents happen again and again: \"One slip and you're gone,\" he says. \"But still, it's something very special. For me, it's an honor to be part of it.\"\n\nMarkus spends the summer alone on the mountain pasture, looking after healthy and sick sheep for months on end. A little further down, in the Schnalstal Valley, his brother Johann looks after the family farm and the animals that spend the summer there.\n\nThe two brothers are bucking a trend, as sheep farming is hardly financially viable anymore. There is little money to be made from the wool and meat of the animals. Shepherds and farmers increasingly need an additional source of income, or are changing their focus completely. \n\nNonetheless, South Tyrolean sheep farmers are still hoping that this season will be better than the last, meaning one without injured sheep, and without accidents. It is important to them that the next generation will also have the opportunity to continue the tradition that has been going on for thousands of years.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sheep #Alps \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Each brand and market has unique operational and customer needs, which means pure architectures often give way to real-world constraints: speed, cost, and team composition.\n\nThis talk is a behind-the-scenes look at how we built the Byte by Yum! platform using a pragmatic mix of AWS services: containers where it makes sense, serverless where it shines, and managed open source where we need control. We‚Äôll show how we created a core platform that supports menu management, ordering, kitchen operations, and AI workflows, using domain primitives that enable rapid iteration and reduced time to market.\n\nWe‚Äôll also explore how we delivered new products quickly using AWS services like EventBridge schedules, DynamoDB streams, and Express Step Functions ‚Äì while achieving high availability, extreme scale, and cost efficiency.\n\nThis is a no-nonsense look at what it takes to build and evolve a global platform: the tradeoffs, the building blocks, and why there‚Äôs never a silver bullet.

I look at other artists, and other artworks, as well as going deeper into artists I've covered on YouTube. \n\nThe channel is fast, visual and conversational, designed for a world of scrolling and streaming, where attention moves quickly. A book moves differently. It gives the artworks space to breathe, lets you linger on details, and allows room for stories that don‚Äôt always fit within a fifteen-minute video.\nOn screen, the camera directs your gaze. On the page, you decide where to look and for how long. In print, reproductions are still and permanent; in video, they are moving and fleeting. Both approaches make art accessible, but they invite different kinds of engagement.\n\nThink of this book not as a replacement for the channel but as its companion. The videos aim to make great art feel immediate.

On 21st July 1403, King Henry IV with his son, the future Henry V, went head to head with a Northern traitor -  Henry Hotspur.  The Battle of Shrewsbury would pit rebel against royalist. Englishman against Englishman. At stake was the crown of England.\n\nMeeting with experts, they will also learn about the power of the longbow - the English super weapon that would now be in the hands of both sides. And also get hands on with some medieval surgery techniques.\n\nFind out how the Battle of Shrewsbury not only changed the history of England - but put the future Henry V on his own path towards destiny.\n\nFor more information about this fascinating battle, please take a look at the following links\n\nhttps://www.battlefieldstrust.com/resource-centre/medieval/battleview.asp?BattleFieldId=39\n\nYou can read Michael‚Äôs brilliant paper about the wound Prince Hal sustained here\nhttps://brill.com/display/book/9789004306455/B9789004306455_011.xml\n\nMichael has also recently published a book on Agincourt - Henry V‚Äôs great victory - but whose DNA can be found at Shrewsbury.
