The Kiel Canal in Germany is the busiest artificial waterway in the world. But keeping it operational is expensive.\n\nThe infrastructure of the Kiel Canal is a much-discussed topic. As is the case in Germany with roads, bridges and railway tracks, cost-cutting measures are also impacting waterways. \n\nYet the canal offers decisive advantages for freight transport: every shipping container transported here replaces a long lorry journey. This saves fuel and improves the freight’s carbon footprint.\n\nEvery year, 25,000 to 30,000 ships pass through the artificial waterway that runs between the port cities of Kiel and Brunsbüttel, connecting the Baltic Sea with the North Sea. But the Kiel Canal, which opened in 1895 and is almost 100 kilometers long, requires constant monitoring and maintenance.\n\nIn the summer of 2024, one of the large lock chambers in Brunsbüttel had to be shut down for several months, and the canal was widened. Up to 30,000 cubic meters of soil were removed here every day to meet the increased demands of shipping traffic. \n\nTwo young boat builders, both named Paul, have little inkling of these challenges. They bought an old sailing boat and made it seaworthy again. The canal and its locks are the first big adventure of their journey, which will take them to the Canary Islands.\n\nThe impressive ships that sail the Kiel Canal have attracted their own fan base. Ship spotters regularly gather on the banks of the canal to watch the majestic cargo ships. \nParking attendant Rainer Schmidt is in charge of maintenance for the Rendsburg viewing point. One of his most important tasks is to keep the hedges trimmed, to ensure the view of the canal is not obstructed.\n\nThe report highlights the different facets of the Kiel Canal and shows how closely people are connected to this waterway. It accompanies them in their everyday lives and during special challenges, against the impressive backdrop of an ageing, but fascinating, technical monument.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #germany #kiel \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Is the universe one predetermined block? Neil deGrasse Tyson and cohosts Chuck Nice and Gary O’Reilly answer grab bag questions about quantum theory, the cosmological constant, and retrocausality with astrophysicist Charles Liu.\n\nWe explore a question about the Big Rip, quarks, and whether tearing the universe apart could spark a brand-new Big Bang. We break down why phantom energy would be required, what dark energy might be, and why current observations suggest the universe probably won’t rip itself to shreds even though we still don’t know what 95% of the cosmos actually is. Could the cosmological constant be changing over time?\n\nCan light help us reconcile relativity and quantum mechanics? We discuss the work of Jacob Barandes at Harvard and whether the \"duality\" of light is the lynchpin to a unified theory. Are today’s mathematical tools just placeholders for physical phenomena? Questions about retrocausality, block time, and whether the universe already exists in full spark reflections on science fiction, free will, and the experiments we can’t yet perform.  Could extra dimensions provide a mathematical loophole for the laws of physics?\n\nWe confront quantum consciousness head-on. Is consciousness rooted in quantum mechanics? Could it persist beyond physical change or even death? We explore philosophical perspectives on Penrose’s ideas, AI consciousness, digital copies of the self, and why “I don’t know” remains the most powerful phrase in science. Along the way: pseudoscience, vaccines, human ignorance, collective behavior, spiritual experiences, and a final reminder that curiosity is what moves us forward.\n\nThanks to our Patrons Jules, Kelton Falls, Danielhero 11, Zaubergarden, Danilo Vieira Battistini, Brian Lacroix, Charles Baker, Matthew Krug, Chris A, Sandra Leduc, Rodney Schneider, Sir Sucknoramus, Dominik Zwahlen, Malachi Vanderpuye, Zac, Will Johnson, John DeGrey, ClumsyVirtuose, Holly Sweet, Chuck Montana, Jeffrey Holt, Stephen, Extronox, Jon, Ben Grund, Jona Smith, Christopher Zalenski, Wile E Coyote, Stephen Patterson, Amber Johnson, Cameron Clark, D.

Few Democratic politicians have leaned into the fight against the Trump administration as aggressively as he has. While some blue-state leaders have tried to find a lane of compromise or quiet resistance, Pritzker has gone the other direction: signing laws to limit ICE operations in Illinois, creating an accountability commission staffed by retired federal judges, suing the federal government, and successfully blocking the deployment of federalized National Guard troops on Chicago’s streets.\n\nPritzker is a unique figure in Democratic politics. A billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotel fortune, he has spent tens of millions of his own dollars to push for a more progressive income tax in Illinois and has advocated for a national wealth tax — policies that would directly cost him money. He's also a Jewish Democrat who has navigated his party’s shifting positions on Israel and Gaza and is a two-term governor who has drawn some public support as a potential 2028 presidential candidate.\n\n00:00 Intro \n01:22 The Illinois playbook against Trump \n03:23 Are Dems too timid in their pushback against Trump? \n05:07 Are our elections safe? \n06:17 Democrats and immigration \n09:27 A billionaire in favor of the wealth tax \n11:12 Is Gov.

We analyze why the FBI is still hiding crucial investigation files—like the 302 victim statements—while Ghislaine Maxwell receives a mysterious prison upgrade and offers conditional testimony. The names are finally out, but as this investigation proves, the cover-up is far from over.\n\nIn this video we ask who are: Les Wexner and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem.  Since the video was released after being questioned by The Guardian - the Department of Justice said that four of the men have no connection to Epstein whatsoever, but rather appeared in a photo lineup assembled by the southern district of New York (SDNY). https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/13/four-men-unredacted-epstein-files-no-ties-ro-khanna\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2186,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/cvOuN5KqufE?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Allegations of Intimidation by Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/rCDMJL6GRMw","date":1771023669,"author":"Bloomberg Originals","guid":27,"unread":true,"content":"<article>A Bloomberg investigation uncovered allegations of intimidation by people questioned by Malaysia’s controversial anti-corruption commission -- claims the commission has denied.  \n\n--------\nLike this video?

New structures of protection, security and dignity are emerging in Ukraine, while war shapes everyday life.\n\nAll of Ukraine has been at war since Russia’s full-scale attack in February 2022. It is a war whose repercussions are inescapable. And it is giving rise to new structures that every country would be happier to be able to live without. \nOne of these is a network of carers who risk their lives to evacuate elderly and sick people from homes that they are often unable to leave on their own. For some, it’s the first journey of their lives, for others, the last. \nA different team, of forensic scientists and military personnel, works to identify the remains of young soldiers. The bodies of the fallen are then transported across Ukraine to their families so that they can be buried in their hometowns. These tasks are all the more difficult, as they must be accomplished amidst the constant threat of bombs and drones. \nAs Russia's war of aggression rages against Ukraine, Yuri Rechinsky documents the everyday lives of those who are too weak to flee, or who care for the dead. He captures impressions of displacement, uncertainty, grief and loss, but also shows moments of solidarity, humor and resilience. \"Dear Beautiful Beloved\" takes a sober look at the survival strategies of people who retain their humanity in the midst of war.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ukraine \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This is because muscles work in a similar way to an endocrine organ: when activated, muscles release messenger substances called myokines, which directly influence our central organs such as the brain, liver, heart and intestines. If we lose muscle mass, these organs can become diseased, or metabolic disorders like diabetes can develop.

A country that promises voluntary taxes and a lean state. It’s a libertarian utopia that’s finding more supporters worldwide.\n\nAfter the Yugoslav Wars, the border between Serbia and Croatia along the Danube river remained unresolved. Vit Jedlička, a former politician from the Czech Republic, took advantage of this situation. He proclaimed the \"Free Republic of Liberland” on a seven-square-kilometer piece of land in 2015. \nLiberland is not internationally recognized, and its president is not allowed to set foot on the soil of his republic. Croatia sees the founding of Liberland as an attack on its territorial integrity.\nThe film accompanies Samuela Davidova, influencer, crypto enthusiast, and spokesperson for Liberland, and Liberland‘s president, Vit Jedlička, on a journey into two very different worlds. \nOn the one hand, they travel to Dubai, a glittering metropolitan meeting place for crypto-enthusiastic elites. Here, they want to recruit investors — and new citizens. \nAnd on the other hand, they travel to \"Ark Village,” the base camp of the Liberland community on Serbian soil. Here, they celebrate the 10th anniversary of Liberland.\nThe highlight of the journey is a boat trip to the shores of Liberland. Liberland claims to function as a meritocracy: taxes are voluntary, but those who invest more have a greater say. \nThe Liberland experiment may seem like an oddity, but it also raises serious questions: Cryptocurrencies and decentralized networks are undermining traditional national borders, and radical market ideas are gaining influence. Parallel structures are emerging. Critics see them as a threat to democracy. Others, of course, sense opportunity. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #liberland #crypto #cryptocurrency \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

If today's quantum computing manufacturers achieve their roadmaps, RSA-2048 will be broken within the next few years. Beyond a sea change for encrypted communications globally, this heralds the arrival of a new era of HPC workflows and the possibility of solving heretofore unsolvable problems.\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss the current state of research into what applications might come online first, the nascent ecosystems for delivering them, and the call to action to all developers to prepare for Q-Day and beyond!

A volcano is considered active if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years. Around 40 to 60 volcanoes erupt every year.\n\nThe eruption of Mont Pelée on the Caribbean island of Martinique is considered the deadliest volcanic eruption of the 20th century. \nOn May 8, 1902, a pyroclastic flow wiped out the island's  cultural capital, Saint-Pierre. Known as the \"Paris of the Caribbean,” the city was located just seven kilometers away from the eruption, and was engulfed in a matter of minutes. An estimated 28,000 to 30,000 people were killed - they were burned, or suffocated. \nThe eruption came as a complete surprise to the islanders, as the signs of the volcano’s activity were ignored. \nThe disaster led to the establishment of the first volcanic observatories and marked the birth of volcanology. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #martinique #volcano \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

This documentary was produced in 2023 and has not been updated for this reupload. It traces the turbulent life of the second son of the former Libyan dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi. In 2021, Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi unexpectedly announced that he would run for the presidency in Libya.\n\nFew had reckoned on this scenario: another Gaddafi vying for power. Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi is the second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi, who was killed in 2011. Now, Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi is a candidate in Libya’s presidential elections.\n\nStatements from relatives and political actors paint a portrait of an unpredictable and fiercely determined man. Saif Al Islam Al Gaddafi’s presidential bid is a major challenge for Libya. The second son of the Libyan dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi has been convicted several times in Libya and is being prosecuted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity.\n\nSaif Al Islam Al Gaddafi has had an unusual life: he grew up a clan that operated with a high degree of paranoia, suspecting conspiracies at work everwhere. Later, he led a playboy lifestyle in Europe, presenting himself to the world as a reformer. In the second phase of his life, which began with the Libyan revolution of 2011, he perpetuated the repressive style of his father’s regime. He was taken prisoner by anti-Gaddifi militias who made him stand trial -- but only allowed him to take part via videolink. \n\nEveryone in Libya is talking about him, all kinds of rumors are doing the rounds, his life is under threat. People say he’s a crazy, sick mystic who’s absconded into the desert. What’s making him run for president, despite the death threats? Does he stand a chance of winning? What does he know about the secret machinations of his father’s regime? His eventful life mirrors the current chaos in Libya: a country divided, with one government in the east and another in the west, rival militias vying for power and foreign states influencing the conflict. With statements from relatives and political actors, the film paints a portrait of Saif Al Islam - an unpredictable and fiercely determined survivor who is trying to find his way.  \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #libya #gaddafi \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

In defiance of President Viktor Orbán’s ban, he organized a Pride march in the city on 28 June 2025—the largest such event ever held in Hungary.\n\nA few months earlier, the government had further tightened its controversial so-called Child Protection Law, which severely restricts the rights of the LGBTQ+ community in Hungary. The Pride event drew supporters both from within the country and abroad. \n\nOur documentary follows Béla, Zsu, and Norbert, who refuse to be intimidated and are prepared to publicly stand up against Orbán’s authoritarian government.\n\nPhotographer Béla Varadi is Roma and identifies as queer. He moved to London a few years after the right-wing nationalist Fidesz party came to power in 2010, making life increasingly hard for queer people and minorities. Béla visited Hungary in 2025 to take photos at the Pride march.\nIn Budapest, Béla meets up with Norbert, who is also Roma and queer. Norbert loves the city, but social tensions are proving challenging. Despite support from his family, Norbert is considering emigrating—a step many queer people in Hungary have already taken.\n\nZsu and Enikő are a young lesbian couple from Budapest. They recently bought a house in the countryside and plan to move there soon. But how will they fare as outsiders in a rural community?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #LGBTQ+ #hungary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice are joined by planetary astrobiologist David Grinspoon to discuss NASA’s return to Venus, our space future, and whether we’ll find life in our solar system. \n\nAs a primary investigator on the upcoming DAVINCI mission, David explains why we haven't sent a dedicated U.S. mission to our sister planet since the 1980s and how the history of \"space futures\" has always been a reflection of our own culture and politics. Neil and David explore the evolution of our planetary visions, from the mass delusion of Martian canals and Jules Verne's moon voyagers to the propaganda efforts during and before the Apollo era. You'll learn how people once assumed every planet was inhabited, only to have their \"cloud swamp\" dreams shattered by the harsh reality of a runaway greenhouse effect.\n\nWhen did scientists realize Venus’s runaway greenhouse and that it wouldn’t have life?  We get into the nuts and bolts of the DAVINCI (2031) and VERITAS missions. How do you build a probe to survive pressures 100 times that of Earth and temperatures hotter than a pizza oven? David breaks down the dive through the Venusian atmosphere, where the mission will capture the first-ever 21st-century measurements and descent photography of the surface. \n\nThey also tackle the phosphine controversy: Could life actually thrive in a permanent global cloud deck? Why isn’t there life in the clouds on Earth, even though you can find life everywhere else? \n\nWith the Europa Clipper heading to Jupiter’s icy moon and the OSIRIS-REX sample from Bennu revealing 14 different amino acids, the kit for life seems to be sprinkled across the cosmos. If the ingredients are common could life itself be too? \n\nThanks to our Patrons Nick Pullia, Sean Cater, Keith Reiss, Seph Gordon, Charlie Viola, Miguel Rangel, Andrew Ferguson, JeAnnette Elaine Thomas, Hugh Caley, Daniel Weber, Chris, Peter Grossman, Darryl Baker, Joyce A Edwards, Maxim, Joshua Richard, Patrick ridlon, Kathleen Reardon, David Watts, Angelina Bryant, Liza, Dave Holloway, Ricardo Andrés Morales Muñoz, Damian Wilson, m. szachacz, Vince Johnson, Lucy, Randal Walcott, Rachel Ambrose, andrew wong, Richard Hudson, Peter Galindo, Mehdi Degryse, Carl Starr M.D., Rodrigo De Luca Comelli, Christian Harris, Ryan Grillo, Jose Villavicencio, Kell, Russ, Mota Ephrahim, Andre Campos-Gomez, Catherine Noiboonsook, Sam McClure, Jerry Taylor, Ian Howarth, Gerrard Lobo, Jordan Strauch, Pretender to the Throne, Dustin, Bulbacats, Jim Mirra, Matt, Adrian Martinez, GuruMojo - Kenny, Malcolm Townes, Russell, Vincent Thomas, Caleb Winters, Carsten, Frank, Andrew Sabado, Roger beeper, Jason Burden, lilacjasminetea, Eric, Samantha, Eric Sneddon, philip griffiths, Christian Chidester, Bruce Berky, Bill Polskoy, Maddux Hammer, Tim Neumark, nathan burcl, Paul Santos, Tognia, sugar, Mike Vacay, Niklas lundkvist, JaneB, Gutek, Natalie &amp; Dad, Ashley, J Sh-Wood, Alexej Muehlberg, and Emery for supporting us this week.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Introduction: David Grinspoon\n02:15 - History of Space Futures\n04:42 - Growing Up with Carl Sagan &amp; Star Trek\n10:30 - Portrayal of Aliens\n12:40 - Popularizing Space\n17:59 - Realizing Other Planets Didn’t Have Life\n20:00 - Mars Canal Conspiracy &amp; War of the Worlds\n25:42 - Going Back to Venus with DAVINCI\n33:30 - Could Life Thrive in the Clouds?\n39:04 - The Health of the Search for Life\n41:33 - What We Found on Asteroid Bennu\n45:09 - Do Aliens Have Music? \n49:20 - Closing Thoughts\n\nCheck out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus\n\nGet the NEW StarTalk book, 'To Infinity and Beyond: A Journey of Cosmic Discovery' on Amazon: https://amzn.to/3PL0NFn\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio\n\nFOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradio\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalk\n\nAbout StarTalk: \nScience meets pop culture on StarTalk!

They discuss how AI tools are transforming developer workflows, making developers about 20% faster on simple tasks while being 19% slower on complex ones.\n\nThe conversation covers critical topics including code quality and trust, security concerns with AI-generated code, the importance of education and best practices, and how developer roles are shifting from syntax experts to system architects. Both experts emphasize that AI tools serve as amplifiers rather than replacements, with humans remaining essential in the loop for quality, security, and licensing compliance.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nPhil Winder • Reinforcement Learning • https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nAlex Castrounis • AI for People and Business • https://amzn.to/3NYKKTo\nHolden Karau, Trevor Grant, Boris Lublinsky, Richard Liu &amp; Ilan Filonenko • Kubeflow for Machine Learning • https://amzn.to/3JVngcx\nKelleher &amp; Tierney • Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) • https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, Robinson &amp; Munn • Machine Learning Design Patterns • https://amzn.to/2ZD7t0x\nLakshmanan, Görner &amp; Gillard • Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision • https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

Games allow us to explore, to create little worlds where we can be different versions of ourselves. But when we turn life into a game — where we have to get the best grade, or the most money, or the most “likes” — then games stop being fun. Why is that?\n\nThis week Sean speaks with philosopher C. Thi Nguyen about what a game really is, the difference between playing for enjoyment and playing to win, and why games lose their magic when the stakes become real.\n\nThi argues that the things we value in life are increasingly captured by grades and likes and downloads and step counts and a thousand other metrics that quietly rewrite what we want and what we think makes us happy.\n\nHost: Sean Illing (@SeanIlling)\nGuest: C.

We dive into the “Social Ponzi Scheme” that enabled decades of abuse, exploring the suspicious real estate transfers, cryptocurrency custodian links, and the international criminal probes that are currently toppling political giants across the globe. From the high-level PR strategies of the “Wall Street Renaissance Man” to the harrowing evidence of a eugenics-obsessed operation, we explore why this long-awaited transparency should not be confused with actual justice.

Initiatives in Germany and Ecuador are calling for equal rights in the workplace, self-determination, and financial independence for women.\n\nOne of the women working for change is surgeon Katja Schlosser. The former head physician at Agaplesion Hospital in Giessen is working with her association \"Die Chirurginnen” (The Female Surgeons) to ensure that female colleagues can continue to practice their profession even during pregnancy. In some clinics, pregnant women are still banned from operating rooms - often due to restrictive interpretations of the Maternity Protection Act. This can put female surgeons at a disadvantage compared to their male colleagues. That’s why Katja Schlosser is calling for an equal say in decision-making processes, as well as equal career opportunities for women.\nStanding up for themselves is often difficult for girls from male-dominated cultures. Take Bahareh Husseini. She fled Iran and now lives in the German city of Düsseldorf. She wanted to study and be able determine her own path in life. In Germany, she found support at Diakonie, a Protestant social welfare organization. There, Jessica te Heesen heads the JUMP project, which helps refugee girls develop self-confidence, assert themselves, and find their way in school and at work. Bahareh is now studying medical physics — and passing on her experiences to others. \nThis is exactly what Patricia Yaselga is promoting with her SEDAL foundation in Ecuador. In the north of the country, many indigenous women have little choice but to work in the cut flower industry. It usually pays only the minimum wage and contaminates the once fertile soil with pesticides and artificial fertilizers. Among the consequences: poverty and malnutrition. SEDAL offers workshops in organic farming for indigenous women so that they can become financially independent and feed their families. The courses don’t just teach them cultivation techniques, but also how to develop self-confidence and assert their rights. Some of the organic farmers are now also politically active in their communities.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #women \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

President Trump blames Latin American cartels. But it all began 30 years ago, quite legally, in the United States.\n\nThe Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, brought the prescription painkiller OxyContin - containing the highly potent opioid oxycodone - onto the market, unleashing one of the greatest health disasters in the history of the United States. With hundreds of sales representatives, they pressured doctors in economically disadvantaged regions to prescribe the drug. \n\nOne of the film's protagonists is Dr Lou Ortenzio, who was himself part of this machinery: he brought the drug to his town of Clarksburg before becoming addicted himself. Former sales representatives, now whistleblowers, report how they lied to doctors and claimed that Oxy was not addictive.\n\nA perfectly oiled machine got millions of Americans hooked - and deceived an entire country. Prosecutors like Maura Healey describe their fight to stop Purdue and bring the Sacklers to justice. The investigations reveal a network of power and influence: Purdue secretly received support from McKinsey, consulting firm to the powerful, and from Publicis, a major advertising agency.\n\nThrough exclusive interviews, insider accounts and previously unpublished archive material, this two-part documentary reveals how the Sacklers bribed regulators, pushed Oxy and evaded justice despite overwhelming evidence. The two-part documentary tells the story of a crisis that continues to devastate parts of American society to this day.\n\n*[Part 2 coming next week]*\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #opioidcrisis  #usa #addictionawareness \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Jasmine Crockett wants you to know she comes by her controversies and clap-backs honestly. The representative from Texas has served just two terms in Congress, but is already a rising political star and a bona fide internet sensation. She’s also become a political lightning rod for Democrats as well as Republicans. Crockett has built her brand on coining phrases that are almost President Donald Trump-like in their virality. She goes after the president and the administration relentlessly, and says it's the only way to stay relevant and gain voters’ trust in the Trump era.\n\nBut if Democrats are less than thrilled with her performance, that’s due more to style than substance, at least, according to her. This week on Today, Explained, Vox’s Astead Herndon travels to Washington, DC, to meet with Crockett and finds her unwilling to back down from her most controversial statements, including comments about some Latino voters having a “slave mentality” and that she doesn’t need Trump voters to win.\n\nRegret and apology are not Crockett’s brand, which has many Democrats worrying about her candidacy for a Senate seat in Texas. In this interview, she walks through her plan and formula for winning that Senate seat: running up the numbers among Black voters, the most loyal voting block for Democrats in Texas, and encouraging nonvoters to participate in the primary.\n\n00:17 Intro \n01:25 Who is a Jasmine Crockett voter?\n01:59 The ‘bleach blonde’ moment: planned or not?\n03:20 Are clapbacks the new Democratic strategy?\n05:28 From public defender to Congress\n07:38 Strategy for Democrats to win \n11:41 Race and racism in US politics\n14:12 Viral anti-Rep.

This means that today, the average representative is responsible for more than 750,000 constituents. Scholars and politicians argue this imbalance helps explain why many Americans feel disconnected from Congress. \n\nRep. Sean Casten (D-IL) has introduced a bill that would expand the House, aiming to restore a vision closer to what the founders intended: a House that expanded with the population. Supporters say more seats could improve representation, but the idea raises a key question: Would a larger House function better — or just add to the gridlock?

They explore how modern software delivery has transformed from simple monolithic deployments to complex microservices ecosystems, drawing parallels between managing production code and managing the \"factory\" that produces it.\n\nThe discussion covers optimization strategies, the balance between local and remote development, platform engineering trends, and how AI is reshaping DevOps practices. Olaf emphasizes that getting software into users' hands is as critical as writing it, and shares how teams can leverage observability, right-sizing, and intelligent automation to improve their delivery pipelines.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nDavid Farley • Continuous Delivery Pipelines • https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines\nJez Humble &amp; Dave Farley • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/3ocIHwd\nNicole Forsgren, Jez Humble &amp; Gene Kim • Accelerate • https://amzn.to/442Rep0\nKim, Humble, Debois, Willis &amp; Forsgren • The DevOps Handbook • https://amzn.to/47oAf3l\nLauren Maffeo • Designing Data Governance from the Ground Up • https://amzn.to/3QhIlnV\nRoy Osherove • The Art of Unit Testing • https://bit.ly/3obiKNB\nBurns, Beda &amp; Hightower • Kubernetes: Up &amp; Running • https://amzn.to/3sueuuI\nGojko Adzic • Lizard Optimization • https://leanpub.com/lizardoptimization\nGregor Hohpe • Platform Strategy • https://amzn.to/4cxfYdb\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

While neighbors like Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia power ahead with new industries and rising exports, Thailand is battling what many economists see as a perfect storm of structural challenges.

This means that today, the average representative is responsible for more than 750,000 constituents. Scholars and politicians say this imbalance is why many Americans feel like Congress is disconnected from them. \n\nSo what if we…added more seats? That’s what Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) is proposing in a new bill because he believes it’s closer to what the country’s founders originally envisioned. While expanding Congress could make our ratio of voters to representatives smaller, it also raises a difficult question: Can a larger, more crowded legislature actually govern, or are we just adding more voices to the gridlock? Vox dives into the math, the history, and the potential future of a \"bigger\" American democracy.\n\nRead more about expanding the House of Representatives:\n\nThe Case for Enlarging the House of Representatives, a report from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, co-authored by Lee Drutman, who’s featured in the video. \nhttps://www.amacad.org/ourcommonpurpose/enlarging-the-house\n\nProtect Democracy: \nhttps://protectdemocracy.org/work/expanding-the-house-of-representatives-explained/\n\nThe text of Rep.

Bikini. It was the first of 23 nuclear tests the US government made in their race against the Soviets during the Cold War. A remote atoll in the Marshall Islands, set in the vast blue expanse of the Pacific Ocean between the Philippines and Hawaii. Ironically though, it was this isolation, that sealed the atoll's fate: During \"Operation Crossroads\" in July of 1946, two atom bombs were used to sink a ghost fleet of 84 vessels, destroying the natural environment and leaving parts of the huge atoll ring permanently contaminated in the process. The islanders are still reliant on imported food even today. The American armed forces singled out Bikini Atoll as the place to detonate the first atomic bombs since Nagasaki. They assembled a huge fleet of decommissioned warships to be sunk in the most dramatic way possible. It wasn't just about testing the destructive power of the bombs though; at the outset of the cold war, they were also seeking to make an impression on the Soviet Union.\n\nYou can now become a History Hit member right here on YouTube!

An investigation from FRONTLINE in partnership with The Associated Press, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, The Post and Courier and AL.com.\n\nThis journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Donate to FRONTLINE now: https://bit.ly/47DFzCb\n\nAnd support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate\n\nFor decades, PFAS, a group of manmade forever chemicals prized for their water- and stain-resistance, were ubiquitous in everything from nonstick pans to raincoats to shoes. But accumulating research has linked some kinds of PFAS to serious health problems. In few places is this issue more pronounced than northwest Georgia, home to some of the world’s largest carpet companies, and now grappling with an environmental crisis.  \n\nThis story unfolds in “Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy,” a documentary investigating how PFAS chemicals once used in making stain-resistant carpets ended up in the environment and the drinking water in parts of Georgia and Alabama, and the ongoing health impacts. \n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is part of a groundbreaking multiplatform investigative collaboration among local and national news organizations. Over much of the past year, the consortium of journalists reviewed thousands of pages of documents and court depositions and interviewed former regulators and industry insiders, as well as doctors, scientists and people who have the kinds of illnesses that researchers have linked to PFAS contamination. \n\nThe carpet industry has long insisted it’s not to blame for PFAS getting into the environment and noted that chemical companies obscured the risks and assured them the products they were supplying were safe. But recently reviewed records also show that executives from two of the largest carpet companies received warnings dating back decades about potential harms of some types of PFAS.\n\nThe companies say they stopped using any kind of PFAS in U.S. manufacturing in 2019. But since PFAS takes so long to break down, communities fear that decades of use of these forever chemicals have made their drinking water unsafe — and local governments say the problem is too vast for them to fix alone.\n\n“Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy” is a FRONTLINE production with Five O’Clock Films in association with the AP, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, AL.com and The Post and Courier.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice dive into questions about the black hole information paradox, moon moons, wormholes between black hole universes, and more! \n\nWhy do astrophysicists worry about lost information, and what actually happens when a molecule meets a singularity? If something goes in and never comes out, does that information leave our universe forever? Neil explains the role of entropy and how particle-antiparticle pairs at the event horizon might just hold the inventory of what the black hole ate. From there, the duo heads into cislunar space. What are the odds of a 2032 asteroid impact, and is it possible for our Moon to capture a moon of its own? Neil explains the energy required to slow down a passing object and why the Moon remains a solitary companion.\n\nThings take a turn for the heroic, and the villainous, as Neil and Chuck debate their comic book alter egos. Why are villains inherently cooler than heroes? If Neil were a superhero, would his signal be the digits of π? Between Chuck’s dreams of Dr. Manhattan-style duplication and Neil’s mission to save the \"geeks\" from bullies, the duo explores the cultural shift that turned nerds into the richest people on Earth.\n\nWhy would the time circuits in Back to the Future lead Marty McFly into the vacuum of space rather than Hill Valley? We break down the orbital mechanics of the Gregorian calendar before shifting to the thermodynamics of the laundry room. If heat makes things expand, why do your clothes shrink in the dryer?\n\nThe show wraps up with a lightning round: Is our universe actually inside a black hole? Could Rick’s portal gun from Rick and Morty actually navigate a multiverse with different laws of physics? Finally, Neil explains the mechanics of accretion disks and those massive black hole jets. If a black hole were headed toward our solar system, would we have any defense at all, or is it time to kiss your ass goodbye?\n\nThanks to our Patrons Dustin Franke, Joel Bradley, Bill, Bailey's Old Guard, Ezrah Davies, Joseph, David Tilbury, David Holt, Andrew Bowen, John Blair, BigShrimpin, Niall Heaton, Stefan Tabakov, Roger McVay, Steve, John Skobrak, Mau Guzmán, Marcus, Michael Astro-Knight, Charlize, Zach Sweet, Trish Edwards, 에이 큐, Michael Kitchen, Alboogie, studioofmars, Anders Öqvist, Liris, Robbie Bentley, Harry Campbell Blyth Clark, Timmeh, Stupot, Wick3dHeathen, Denise Pinheiro, Kenneth Millen, Porn Person, Bill, PotatoGraphick, Conrad Dunfee, Steve A, Priit Pääsukene, Étienne Pouly, thomas rodriguez, Jibak, Michael S, Kerin McGee, Kyle Young, S.P., Adam Sweeney, Micah Sell, Austin, Emmyb, Caiden Osborne, Devinder Singh, John Posey, Thierry Hubert, Spider, B.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

The film follows Justice Marshall, known as “Mr. Civil Rights,” from his legal career with the NAACP to his 1967 appointment to the nation’s highest court.\n\nFollow Justice Marshall’s journey from his birth in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1908 through his years at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Lincoln University and Howard University School of Law, and his groundbreaking career as a lawyer championing civil rights and dismantling school segregation. Marshall won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the U.S. Supreme Court, including the landmark Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, invalidating the separate but equal doctrine and ending racial segregation in public schools. In 1967, Marshall became the first African American appointed to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. \n\nBecoming Thurgood: America’s Social Architect\n\nThis program is made possible by viewers like you.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice dive into human psychology and how common knowledge is the invisible glue holding civilization together with cognitive scientist and author of When Everyone Knows What Everyone Knows, Steven Pinker.\n\nHow do we know we know that other people know we know? We start with the biological roots of social coordination: does money only have value because we all agree it does? How do common knowledge generators, like eye contact and public ceremonies, differ from private information? Steven explains the two-way duplicity of weasel words and innuendo, revealing the logic behind benign hypocrisy. Why do we say \"Netflix and chill\" instead of being direct? Discover the game theory behind saving face, the necessity of plausible deniability in society, and how a psychologist bribes a waiter.\n\nWe discuss the evolutionary purpose of blushing, laughter, and tears. We revisit Charles Darwin’s work on facial expressions as a tool against scientific racism, proving our shared ancestry through the universal language of emotion. We take a look at the Emperor’s New Clothes effect in modern politics and economics. From bank runs and the 1970s toilet paper shortage to the contest of crypto and primary elections, find out how common knowledge can trigger speculative bubbles and why breaking social norms can permanently shatter the common expectation of civility. Could spreading civil norms be the ultimate fix for a polarized society?\n\nThanks to our Patrons Zypherior (Fjottrik), Brett Peterson, Sheila Weinhardt, baltimega, Eric Gouse, Mathias Toft, Mike, Alex Boyer, Joey, Nathan, Mark, logan, Tal Rozow, Craig F, Nathir Kassam, Doug Calli, Artem, Jay Sawyer, Owen Aston, Tyler, smbriggs1, Galaxy Master, Stephanie Edwards, Fahad Sadiq, Erasmus, Margaret Kaczorowski, Julia, Marie Rausku, Andrew Talley, Wayne2566, Rob Weber, Eric Cabrera, Galarian Rowlet, Mark S.

The $14 billion deal, brokered by a consortium of politically connected investors, was supposed to end the years of national security concerns and protect the data of 170 million US users. Instead, the new TikTok USDS Joint Venture has stumbled out of the gate with a series of \"technical glitches\" that look suspiciously like targeted censorship. From the inexplicable blocking of the word \"Epstein\" in direct messages to the suppression of protest videos in Minneapolis, the new management’s first week has raised a troubling question: did we actually solve the problem of algorithmic manipulation, or did we just ensure that the people doing the manipulating are the ones who helped broker the deal?\n\nThis video examines the bizarre political U-turn that turned TikTok from a national emergency into a sweetheart deal for insiders. We look at the new owners, the incredibly invasive \"biometric harvesting\" hidden in the new Terms of Service, and the \"Rational Business Actor\" theory that suggests no company would be dumb enough to break its own product on day one. We also explore the \"Mecha-Hitler\" problem of content moderation, and why the \"National Security\" label may now be acting as a permanent shield against transparency for a platform that is now 100% domestic, 100% private, and perhaps, 100% MAGA.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2390,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/n_wNCLdlV7w?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Why the P-47 Thunderbolt was so big","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/k0ywNyoDAcI","date":1769860889,"author":"Imperial War Museums","guid":545,"unread":true,"content":"<article>#history #p47 #thunderbolt #aviation #ww2planes</article>","contentLength":47,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/k0ywNyoDAcI?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Contaminated: The Carpet Industry’s Toxic Legacy (trailer) | FRONTLINE","url":"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TQo0tU_azkU","date":1769806834,"author":"FRONTLINE PBS | Official","guid":478,"unread":true,"content":"<article>How did PFAS chemicals once used in popular stain-resistant carpets end up in the water and environment in parts of Georgia, Alabama and South Carolina?\n\nFRONTLINE, @AssociatedPress, @ajcvideo, @postandcourier, and @aldotcom investigate what happened with these forever chemicals and the ongoing health impacts.\n\n#news #documentary #trailer \n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline\nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.\n\nThe editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with major support from Ford Foundation.

The conversation explores why this happens, what capabilities organizations need before scaling AI adoption, and how AI acts as an amplifier of existing systems rather than a silver bullet.\n\nNathen introduces DORA's seven AI capabilities model and discusses critical issues around trust, documentation, skill devaluation, and the future of software delivery in an AI-native world.\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nEmily Freeman &amp; Nathen Harvey • 97 Things Every Cloud Engineer Should Know • https://amzn.to/3UlWBLt\nCharles Humble • Professional Skills for Software Engineers • https://www.conissaunce.com/professional-skills-shortcut\nNicole Forsgren, Jez Humble &amp; Gene Kim • Accelerate • https://amzn.to/442Rep0\nKim, Humble, Debois, Willis &amp; Forsgren • The DevOps Handbook • https://amzn.to/47oAf3l\nJez Humble &amp; David Farley • Continuous Delivery • https://amzn.to/452ZRky\nJez Humble, Joanne Molesky &amp; Barry O'Reilly • Lean Enterprise • https://amzn.to/47pcOXD\nAdrienne Braganza Tacke • \"Looks Good to Me\": Constructive Code Reviews • https://amzn.to/3E75XrD\nYevgeniy Brikman • Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery • https://amzn.to/3WMPMFU\n\n\nBluesky (https://bsky.app/profile/gotocon.com) \nTwitter (https://twitter.com/GOTOcon) \nInstagram (https://www.instagram.com/goto_con) \nLinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-) \nFacebook (https://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences) \n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

So, what causes herpes? And how can we treat it?

Brooksley Born spoke for the first time on television about her failed campaign to regulate the secretive, multitrillion-dollar derivatives market whose crash helped trigger the financial collapse in the fall of 2008.\n\n“We didn’t truly know the dangers of the market, because it was a dark market,” said Born, who was the head of an obscure federal regulatory agency — the Commodity Futures Trading Commission [CFTC]. Born not only warned of the potential for economic meltdown in the late 1990s, but also tried to convince the country’s key economic powerbrokers to take actions that could have helped avert the crisis.\n\nThe documentary also revealed an intense battle among high-ranking members of former President Bill Clinton’s administration and uncovered a concerted effort not to regulate the emerging, highly complex, and lucrative derivatives markets, which became a ticking time-bomb within the American economy.\n\nExplore additional reporting on “The Warning” on our website:\nhttps://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/warning/ \n\n#Documentary #UnitedStates #FinancialCrisis #GreatRecession #Economy\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/user/PBSfrontline \nSign up for our newsletter: https://frontline.org/newsletter\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\nBluesky: https://bsky.app/profile/frontlinepbs.bsky.social\n\nFRONTLINE is produced at GBH in Boston and airs nationwide on PBS.\n\nThe editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, with major support from Ford Foundation.

Through their individual stories, viewers experience the war through the memories of the men and women who experienced it: the rank-and-file Continental soldiers and American militiamen (some of them teenagers), Patriot political and military leaders, British Army officers, American Loyalists, Native soldiers and civilians, enslaved and free African Americans, German soldiers in the British service, French and Spanish allies, and various civilians living in North America, Loyalist as well as Patriot, including many made refugees by the war.\n\nThe Revolution began a movement for people around the world to imagine new and better futures for themselves, their nations, and for humanity. It declared American independence with promises that we continue to strive for. The American Revolution opened the door to advance civil liberties and human rights, and it asked questions that we are still trying to answer today.\n\nThe film, narrated by Peter Coyote, includes the first-person voices of nearly 200 individual historic figures, read by a cast of actors, including Adam Arkin, Jeremiah Bitsui, Corbin Bleu, Kenneth Branagh, Josh Brolin, Bill Camp, Tantoo Cardinal, Josh Charles, Hugh Dancy, Claire Danes, Jeff Daniels, Keith David, Hope Davis, Marcus Davis-Orrom, Bruce Davison, Leon Dische Becker, Alden Ehrenreich, Craig Ferguson, Morgan Freeman, Christian Friedel, Paul Giamatti, Domhnall Gleeson, Amanda Gorman, Michael Greyeyes, Jonathan Groff, Charlotte Hacke, Tom Hanks, Ethan Hawke, Maya Hawke, Lucas Hedges, Josh Hutcherson, Samuel L.

Faced with what it views as transactional coercion, Brussels is readying an arsenal of economic countermeasures, ranging from a \"trade bazooka\" targeting U.S. tech firms to the highly publicized \"financial nuclear option\"—the threat of dumping trillions in U.S. Treasuries. But before we panic about a bond market collapse, we need to examine the hard financial realities: Is weaponizing sovereign debt a viable strategy, or is it merely a macroeconomic suicide pact? This video dives into the mechanics of this potential economic war and the high cost of moving from an era of global efficiency to one of fearful autarky\n\nMichael Pettis Paper: https://carnegieendowment.org/china-financial-markets/2025/07/foreign-capital-inflows-dont-lower-us-interest-rates\nMartin Wolf Article: https://www.ft.com/content/e2c8c6c3-0cdc-4aa8-a47d-399407c75ad9\nRichard Samans Paper: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/rebalancing-the-world-economy-right-idea-but-wrong-approach/\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2412,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/L_zlYjjtNPM?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Timeline: 1960 - Everything That Happened In The Year 1960","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdXrJr5f6AQ","date":1769353237,"author":"Weird History","guid":698,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Weird History Timeline is back!

As America faces a high-stakes standoff over the future of the Federal Reserve, the traditional independence of the nation’s central bank is under direct attack. This video explores the intensifying war between the White House and Fed Chair, over a $2.5 billion headquarters renovation. We break down why many experts believe this probe is a mere pretext intended to bully the Fed into slashing interest rates to rock-bottom levels, potentially putting the long-term stability of the U.S. economy at risk for short-term political gains.\n\nWe also take a closer look at the \"agents of chaos\" Bill Pulte, Judge Jeanine Pirro and the \"shadow\" economic strategies currently in play, from the FHFA’s controversial bond-buying programs to the proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. From the strategic blockade in the Senate by Senator Thom Tillis to the \"Miran Limbo\" on the Fed’s Board of Governors, we unpack the technical and political maneuvers being used to bypass Jerome Powell. Is the U.S. headed toward a \"banana republic\" risk premium, or can its institutional guardrails hold firm? Join us as we examine the true price of a political Fed and what it means for the future of the dollar.\n\nPatrick's Books:\nStatistics For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3eerLA0\nDerivatives For The Trading Floor:  https://amzn.to/3cjsyPF\nCorporate Finance:  https://amzn.to/3fn3rvC \n\nWays To Support The Channel\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/PatrickBoyleOnFinance\nBuy Me a Coffee: https://www.buymeacoffee.com/patrickboyle\n\nVisit our website: https://www.onfinance.org\nFollow Patrick on Twitter Here: https://bsky.app/profile/pboyle.bsky.social\n\nBusiness Inquiries ➡️ sponsors@onfinance.org\n\nPatrick Boyle On Finance Podcast:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/7uhrWlDvxzy9hLoW0EYf0b\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/patrick-boyle-on-finance/id1547740313\nGoogle Podcasts: https://tinyurl.com/62862nve\n\nJoin this channel to support making this content:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw/join</article>","contentLength":2378,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QXUQ7PzuIe0?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Everything You Weren't Taught About Shakespeare","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YgVk-O20Iw","date":1768748428,"author":"Weird History","guid":695,"unread":true,"content":"<article>William Shakespeare’s plays have shaped the English language, defined genres, and given high-schoolers panic attacks over pop quizzes for centuries.

For Soviet naval planners, a nightmare scenario was unfolding. If war broke out, American submarines could find and destroy Soviet submarines before they had a chance to strike back.\n\nSimply catching up to American stealth wasn't an option. It wasn't a technology that could easily be copied, it was the result of decades of precision manufacturing, relentless quality control, advances in materials science, and industrial discipline that the Soviet system couldn't support at the time. It would take decades to catch up.\n\nFaced with a widening stealth technology gap, Soviet planners stopped trying to play hide and seek under the oceans, and instead chose raw power. They would bet everything on speed, depth, maneuverability and brute force.\n\nIn 1960, the Soviet Union launched their most ambitious submarine programs in history. Project 705 ‘Lira’, later designated as the ‘Alfa Class’ submarine by NATO, was a nuclear-powered attack submarine capable of outrunning torpedoes, executing extreme maneuvers, and diving deeper than anything the world had ever seen. Built with a revolutionary liquid-metal nuclear reactor, advanced automation, and a titanium hull, this machine represented a generational leap in engineering.\nIt wasn’t just a faster submarine, it was a radical attempt to rewrite the rules of underwater warfare.\n\nWhen Western intelligence realized what the Soviets were building, it caused immediate panic. A submarine that could outrun torpedoes and dive beyond existing weapons threatened to upend NATO’s entire anti-submarine strategy, forcing the West into a sudden scramble to catch up.\n\nBut Project 705, a super submarine meant to restore balance beneath the seas, would prove to be far more than the Soviets ever bargained for.\n\nThanks for watching!</article>","contentLength":2593,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/j6ttTK8x8ZA?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null}],"tags":["yt"]}
