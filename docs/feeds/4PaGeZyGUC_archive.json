Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.\n \nFor months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.\n \nDW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.\n \nIf you have a tip, feel free to contact DW's investigative unit here: https://www.dw.com/en/do-you-have-confidential-information-that-you-want-to-share-with-dw/a-61899300\n\n#documentary #investigation #reporter #dwstories #dwdocumentary \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Bring up the railguns, let‚Äôs finish this and go home.‚Äô - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015\n\nElectromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.\n\nThe lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.\n\nThis will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852).

When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick‚Äôs crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.\n\nIn this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert.

So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).\n\nWe'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn!

Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.\n\nNext, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter‚Äîcould it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what‚Äôs been eluding us.\n\nPlus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself‚Äîwhat would happen if we were hit by one? Is ‚Äúnow‚Äù just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy?

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.\n\nThe young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin‚Äôs high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.\n\nJustin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.\n\nConor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he‚Äôs running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.\n\nDespite the government‚Äôs promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate. \n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #ireland  #housing \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

People also began to question the price they had paid for efforts made at protecting themselves and others against this virus. \n\nWhat impact did the coronavirus pandemic have on our life?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs\n______\n\nWe kindly ask viewers to read and stick to the DW netiquette policy on our channel: https://p.dw.com/p/MF1G</article>","contentLength":1212,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/QkYaMcaT-zg?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"The century-old technology that could change the world - Rachel Yang","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f-T0PEWRaVc","date":1741705304,"author":"TED-Ed","guid":111,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Dig into the science of thermal batteries, and how this technology can generate heat more efficiently than fossil fuels.\n\n--\n\nIndustrial manufacturers spend a huge amount of energy generating heat to make everyday materials and objects, like cement, steel, and paper.

Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.\n\nWhen you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ‚ÄùShould I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?‚Äù There‚Äôs no simple answer, but there‚Äôs a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. \n\nThe first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it‚Äôs below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&amp;P 500. If your debt ‚Äî like a mortgage or a student loan ‚Äî falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You‚Äôll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. \n\nHigher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.\n\nFurther reading: \n\nHow to Prioritize Retirement Savings vs. Debt Payoff, Bill Fay\nhttps://www.debt.org/retirement/prioritize-savings-vs-payoff/\n\nShould you pay down debt or invest?, Fidelity\nhttps://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/personal-finance/pay-down-debt-vs-invest\n\nDebt Destroyer, a US government online tool to help make a plan to eliminate debt\nhttps://finred.usalearning.gov/debt-destroyer-calculator/debt-destroyer-calculator.html\n\nNote: The title of this video has been updated\nPrevious title: When it's okay to wait to pay off debt\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

It‚Äôs often a long way to travel to see a doctor, and treatment is expensive. But an organization from Germany is providing those affected with orthopedic aids, as well as training specialists.\n\nIn Uganda, people with disabilities not only often live in great poverty, there‚Äôs also hardly any medical care available to them. For more than 10 years now, an organization from Usingen in the German state of Hesse has been providing people with prostheses and other orthopedic aids. In the small town of Kiyunga near the capital Kampala, ProUganda has set up a center with a modern orthopedic workshop and treatment rooms.\nBut not everyone can get there: The roads are uneven and it‚Äôs difficult for poor families to get to Kiyunga with their children. That‚Äôs why the team travels to rural areas in minibuses. In the trunk: wheelchairs, some delivered second-hand from Germany, some bought with donations.\nThe film accompanies members of the aid organization as they work with patients in Kiyunga, in the workshop and on missions in the region.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #uganda #medical #africa \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.\n\nIn this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.\n\nTo many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. \n\nThe public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn‚Äôt see his family for months so as not to infect them.\n\nWhen the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.\n\nBy now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aur√©lie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aur√©lie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.\n\nAs the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #coronavirus #pandemic \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.\n\nFour women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan‚Äôs hard-won rights. \n\nThe team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #afghanistan #womenrights \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU‚Äôs border protection agency‚Äôs reputation. But now, it‚Äôs trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.\n\nThe message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? \n\nThe new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He‚Äôs said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #frontex #humanrights #migration \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

That‚Äôs not new.\n\nSupport our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships\n\nOn the first day of Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump‚Äôs order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges ‚Äî but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it‚Äôs uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it‚Äôs very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?\n\nThe short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today‚Äôs concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They‚Äôre actually not.\n\n00:00 A rule\n2:23 Jus soli\n3:13 Dred Scott\n4:46 The 14th Amendment\n8:02 Wong Kim Ark\n10:30 Another look at the 14th Amendment\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nGarrett Epps‚Äôs law review article about the citizenship clause of the 14th Amendment has everything you‚Äôll ever need to know about the history of birthright citizenship in the US: https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1607&amp;context=aulr\n\nThe Library of Congress has a great map showing which countries of the world offer unconditional birthright citizenship like the US: https://maint.loc.gov/law/help/birthright-citizenship/birthright-citizenship-map.pdf\n\nThe 1861 map of the US we use a few times in the piece is itself a strikingly rich document that I could stare at forever: https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701sm.gct00482/?sp=33\n\nSome other original documents we use in the piece:\n\nTrump‚Äôs executive order on birthright citizenship: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02007.pdf\n\nThe Ipsos poll containing the question about support for ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants: https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/documenttools/f548560f100205ef/e656ddda-full.pdf\n\nThe Dred Scott decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep060/usrep060393a/usrep060393a.pdf\n\nPresident Andrew Johnson‚Äôs letter vetoing the 1866 Civil Rights Act: https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/veto-message-438\n\nCongress‚Äôs debates over the 14th Amendment (we quoted from page 498): https://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/congress-39-session-1-part-1.pdf\n\nThe 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act: https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000/pdf/SERIALSET-04239_00_00-022-0291-0000.pdf\n\nThe Wong Kim Ark decision: https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep169/usrep169649/usrep169649.pdf\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.\n\nWith this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.\n\nLearn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:\n‚Ä¢ The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between\n‚Ä¢ How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain\n‚Ä¢ The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture‚Äîand how to best interact with it\n‚Ä¢ How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code\n\n* Book description: ¬© O'Reilly:\nhttps://www.oreilly.com/library/view/prompt-engineering-for/9781098153427\n\nTIMECODES\n00:00 Intro\n02:27 Key aspects of Prompt Engineering &amp; its definition\n08:22 Misconceptions about Prompt Engineering\n10:21 Practical applications &amp; tools\n13:43 5 principles of prompting\n26:27 Balancing creativity &amp; specificity in AI models\n32:42 RAG: The power of iterative steps, query planning &amp; routing in AI systems\n42:59 Understanding agentic systems: Beyond prompt-based AI\n51:56 Outro\n\nRECOMMENDED BOOKS\nJames Phoenix &amp; Mike Taylor ‚Ä¢ Prompt Engineering for Generative AI ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/43cFDqO\nPhil Winder ‚Ä¢ Reinforcement Learning ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3t1S1VZ\nKelleher &amp; Tierney ‚Ä¢ Data Science (The MIT Press Essential Knowledge series) ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3AQmIRg\nLakshmanan, G√∂rner &amp; Gillard ‚Ä¢ Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision ‚Ä¢ https://amzn.to/3m9HNjP\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GOTOcon\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/company/goto-\nhttps://www.instagram.com/goto_con\nhttps://www.facebook.com/GOTOConferences\n#PromptEngineering #Prompting #GenerativeAI #RAG #RetrievalAugmentedGeneration #DAG #DirectAcyclicGraphs #ChatGPT #ReinforcementLearning #DSPyOptimizers #GenAI #AIUseCase #ArtificialIntelligence #ML #DataScience #JamesPhoenix #MikeTaylor #PhilWinder #BookClub\n\nCHANNEL MEMBERSHIP BONUS\nJoin this channel to get early access to videos &amp; other perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA/join\n\nLooking for a unique learning experience?\nAttend the next GOTO conference near you!

This special forest is home to countless spruce and fir trees. One very special species towers above them all, giving many animals shelter: the giant arbor vitae, or ‚ÄòTree of Life‚Äô.\n\nThe proud giant, which can live for up to a thousand years, plays an important role in the mythology of the Nuxalk. These indigenous people communicate with their ancestors through the tree. But the tree of life also plays a key role in the ecosystem and is home to numerous species - from the smallest insects to stately mammals. The animals crawl into its trunk or find shelter under its bushy foliage. \n\nThe giant arbor vitae has watched over the Canadian rainforest and the adjacent ocean for thousands of years. Every fall, the salmon return to their native rivers in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest after spending several years at sea. They fight their way upstream to spawn - and provide a feast for the bears, who devour the delicious fish in the shade of the trees. \nNothing is lost in the forest. Scavengers feed on any remains left among the tree roots and whatever is left nourishes the rich forest soil with nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, even the salmon promote tree growth and contribute to a unique ecosystem. \n\nForest and ocean live in symbiosis here. When heavy rainfall erodes the soil, nutrients are transported through the rivers to the sea, where they benefit the humpback whales. Nowadays, however, this complex ecosystem is threatened by massive logging. Here, too, humans are jeopardizing a balance that has existed for thousands of years.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #canada #environment #nature \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment.

These establishments were especially important for those who didn‚Äôt have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.\n\nWe visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.\n\nMade possible by viewers like you.

Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.\n\nFor those who couldn‚Äôt afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas‚Äîmulti-story buildings in Rome‚Äîrelied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.\n\nFish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.</article>","contentLength":2898,"flags":null,"enclosureUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/v/utTF7dXcxfQ?version=3","enclosureMime":"","commentsUrl":null},{"title":"Neil & a Plasma Physicist Discuss the Future of Fusion Energy","url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kf4NyRbvkmM","date":1741114490,"author":"StarTalk","guid":503,"unread":true,"content":"<article>Is fusion the future of energy and space travel? Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.\n\nWe begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.\n\nFusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches‚Äîfrom Princeton‚Äôs tokamak designs to Livermore‚Äôs laser-driven experiments‚Äîand why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.\n\nBut fusion isn‚Äôt just about energy‚Äîit‚Äôs also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.\n\nFinally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs?

The World Food Programme says nearly 25 million people are facing acute food shortages - all driven by a war that has received little international attention.\n\nAid organizations warn that the dimension of the crisis surpasses those in Ukraine, Gaza and Somalia combined. The conflict has been running since 2023, pitting army chief and de facto president Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan against his former deputy Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The fighting has displaced 12 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. Yet, the crisis is barely present in the international media. That‚Äôs partly because journalists are rarely given access to the war zone. But DW correspondent Mariel M√ºller managed to secure permission to film from the Sudanese army. Embedded with military forces, she traveled to the capital Khartoum, where the paramilitary RSF control swathes of territory and the battle for dominance continues to rage - leaving the civilian population trapped in the crossfire. And the conflict shows no signs of ending soon.\n\n#documentary #dwdocumentary #dwdocs #sudan #warzone \n______\n\nDW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

However, the glue code that we write to stitch everything together tends to be brittle, and a constant inertia to change.\n\nThis talk explores how to leverage existing API specs (OpenAPI and gRPC) to deliver composition and federation of APIs, without writing and maintaining glue code.\n\nWe'll explore how using API Specs as First Class Citizens of our enterprise integration, along with Semantic Metadata, allows us to create a mesh of services that connect on demand, and self-adapt their middleware as services around them change.\n\nThis is an in-depth exploration into Taxi - a meta-language for annotating API specs, and TaxiQL - a query language and open source orchestration engine, which can generate and adapt integration on demand.

But many of them propagated misunderstandings of the properties of the architectural style. Mis-associations with the Cloud Native style, and misapprehensions on how to move from monolith to microservices, meant that the architectures that emerged often bear little resemblance to the original idea; most are just distributed monoliths. Unsurprisingly these architectures are painful and costly to own. Ten years later, the resulting failure to realise the benefits promised by microservices, or a misunderstanding of what they were, has led to a backlash against microservices; now the prevalent wisdom calls for a \"return to the monolith,\" and posters on Reddit have begun to speak of \"Death by a Thousand Microservices.\"\n\nThis talk looks at the key misunderstandings around microservices: the problems that microservices were intended to solve; \"what does micro mean?\"; how to achieve independent deployability; how to avoid anti-patterns like a distributed monolith. It will also explain the problems that a monolith can't solve that cause us to choose microservices.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice welcome best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell to explore the hidden forces that drive human behavior.\n\nGladwell shares the origins of The Tipping Point and its new sequel, Revenge of the Tipping Point, sparked by his fascination with epidemiology and crime in 1980s New York. How do social problems spread like viruses? Why do some people‚Äîor places‚Äîbecome \"superspreaders\" of everything from ideas to violence? We uncover the surprising role of environmental contagion in shaping societies and ask whether AI could revolutionize public health and policing.\n\nWe dive into the power of context: why do doctors in Buffalo and Denver treat heart disease differently? What can poop samples tell us about the next pandemic? And why might trained dogs be the future of disease detection? From the science of masks to hotspot policing, Gladwell unpacks the patterns behind epidemics of all kinds‚Äîbiological, social, and criminal.\n\nWhat will future generations find baffling about today?

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth.

Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks ‚Ä¶. good!\n\nBut de-aging effects haven‚Äôt always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 ‚Äî and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had ‚Ä¶ varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods ‚Äî but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.\n\nHere‚Äôs VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren‚Äôt going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.\n\nBut the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn‚Äôt stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It‚Äôs an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier.
