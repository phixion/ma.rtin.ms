. Seager said the engineering team is focused on replacing key system components with Rust-based alternatives to enhance safety and resilience, starting with Ubuntu 25.10. He stressed that resilience and memory safety, not just performance, are the principal drivers: "It's the enhanced resilience and safety that is more easily achieved with Rust ports that are most attractive to me". This move is echoed in Ubuntu's adoption of sudo-rs, the Rust implementation of sudo, with fallback and opt-out mechanisms for users who want to use the old-school sudo command. 


In addition to sudo-rs, Ubuntu 26.04 will use the Rust-based uutils/coreutils for Linux's default core utilities. This setup includes ls, cp, mv, and dozens of other basic Unix command-line tools. This Rust reimplementation aims for functional parity with GNU coreutils, with improved safety and maintainability. 

On the desktop front, Ubuntu 26.04 will also bring seamless TPM-backed full disk encryption. If this approach reminds you of Windows BitLocker or MacOS FileVault, it should. That's the idea. 

In other news, Canonical CEO Mark Shuttleworth said "I'm a believer in the potential of Linux to deliver a desktop that could have wider and universal appeal." (Although he also thinks "the open-source community needs to understand that building desktops for people who aren't engineers is different. We need to understand that the 'simple and just works' is also really important.") 


Shuttleworth answered questions from Slashdot's readers in 2005 and 2012.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tanzania&apos;s Hassan declared winner in election marred by violence | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0MwfYsi6sY</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_0MwfYsi6sY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 17:20:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tanzania's electoral commission said that President Samia Suluhu Hassan had won, with nearly 98% of the votes, in an election that set off violent protests across the country.

The mystery object that struck a plane at 36,000 feet is likely not space debris, as some speculated, but rather a Silicon Valley test project gone wrong... 

WindBorne Systems, a Palo Alto startup that uses atmospheric balloons to collect weather data for AI-based forecast models,has come forward to say that they believe they may be responsible for the object that hit the windshield... "At 6am PT, we sent our preliminary investigation to both NTSB and FAA, and are working with both of them to investigate further," [WindBorne's CEO John Dean posted on social media...]
 WindBorne said the company has launched more than 4,000 balloons and that it coordinates with the Federal Aviation Administration for every launch. 

WindBorne "has conducted more than 4,000 launches," the company said in a statement, noting that they've always coordinated those launched with America's Federal Aviation Administration and filed aviation alerts for every launched balloon. Plus "The system is designed to be safe in the event of a midair collision... Our balloon is 2.4 pounds at launch and gets lighter throughout flight."


We are working closely with the FAA on this matter. We immediately rolled out changes to minimize time spent between 30,000 and 40,000 feet. These changes are already live with immediate effect. Additionally, we are further accelerating our plans to use live flight data to autonomously avoid planes, even if the planes are at a non-standard altitude. We are also actively working on new hardware designs to further reduce impact force magnitude and concentration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Shutdown threatens heating assistance for millions as winter approaches</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwwMty-HDLg</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JwwMty-HDLg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 16:32:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Nearly six million low-income US families may face delays in receiving home heating aid due to the ongoing federal government shutdown.

I’ve been using DigitalOcean since 2013. Personally, I don’t use it often, but I log in several times a week to support clients hosted there.A chuckle and twelve years of cloud loveOver the past twelve years I have set up and managed countless droplets, and DigitalOcean’s support and uptime have been excellent; this isn’t that kind of post.It’s a lighthearted look at what happens when automation churns out more notifications than the situation may warrant, and why even a penny‑sized bill can teach us bigger lessons about design and efficiency.On Saturday, 25 October 2025, an email with the subject “Payment required: Your pre‑payment has been used” arrived in my inbox. It informed me that my prepaid credit was insufficient to cover the month’s usage and urged me to “make another payment or add an alternate payment method.”There was just one catch: the outstanding balance was $0.01. I chuckled, and went on with my day only to receive the exact message two more times over the coming days. By the time Saturday rolled around, my inbox looked like this:The inbox search screenshot above shows the cadence: identical “Payment required” messages on October 25th, 28th, and 31st, 2025, followed by an email on November 1, 2025, titled “Your 2025‑10 invoice is available.”The invoice email (screenshot also above) contains a table that lists the usage charges for October as $0.01, notes that the payment method will only be charged if the balance exceeds $3.00, and invites me to “View Invoice.” Here’s what those other three messages look like:My immediate reaction was a bit of a chuckle, but by the fourth email, I was more curious than anything: Why does an automated billing system send four emails about a 1-cent balance? DigitalOcean’s billing documentation notes that invoices are generated monthly. In my case, the system sent several “action required” emails, maybe because I don’t have a payment method saved? But in any case, I rarely use my personal DigitalOcean account beyond just quick tests:This experience of multiple emails for 1 cent owed, prompted me to think about the hidden costs of excessive email notifications and how we can design billing and alerting in a more thoughtful way.The True Cost of an EmailEmail feels free because individuals don’t pay per message, but providers do. A 2025 breakdown of email marketing costs notes that the typical cost for a business to send emails is $1–$2 per thousand messages, translating to roughly $0.001–$0.002 per email. Amazon’s Simple Email Service charges $0.10 per 1,000 emails for outbound messages (sending or receiving) and a few cents per gigabyte for attachments.This cost is likely less for DigitalOcean, with the three “Payment required” notices and one invoice with attachment costing the company at most between a tenth and two‑tenths of a cent to send. But multiply that by hundreds of thousands of customers, and it highlights how easy it is to use resources to clutter inboxes over microbalances.The monetary cost is only part of the picture. Email has an environmental footprint because electricity powers servers, networks, and client devices. Researchers estimate that more than 306 billion emails were sent in 2021, and the total is expected to hit almost 400 billion this year, thanks to DigitalOcean. jk!!According to Mike Berners‑Lee, a short text email can produce 0.2–0.3 g of CO₂, while a longer message with attachments can produce 17 g; an email blast to 100 people may generate 26 g or more. Email‑related emissions accounted for approximately 150 million tons of CO₂e in 2019. That’s about 0.3% of the world’s carbon footprint. But more importantly, about 25% added to users’ annoyance levels – Source: Notification fatigue and design principlesIt isn’t just about costs or the environment. Usability tests consistently show that frequent alerts are one of the top user complaints. In fact, it’s been proven by Facebook and others that sending fewer notifications can be better for both engagement and retention.Good notification design also recognizes levels of severity: high‑attention alerts (e.g., security breaches or failed payments) should prompt immediate action, while low‑attention messages (informational updates) can be bundled or deferred. Services like Slack, for example, adapt notification frequency automatically when channels become very active.Looking at DigitalOcean’s billing reminders, it’s easy to see opportunities for improvement. A one‑cent balance does not warrant three emails + an invoice. The first message could have been informational (“heads up, your balance is low”), the second might wait until the balance crosses a predetermined threshold (say $1 or $3), and the third could be a month or 3 months later.Alternatively, DigitalOcean could incorporate a small balance waiver similar to the one many credit card issuers use. Banks recognize that it’s not cost‑effective to chase pennies; they round down or apply a credit adjustment on the next statement. The same logic could help cloud providers reduce overhead and user frustration.It’s not just DigitalOcean: micro‑balances happen everywhereDigitalOcean isn’t alone in sending tiny bills. Back in 2013, an Optus customer in Australia posted on Whirlpool forums that a billing error left them with a one‑cent overdue notice after receiving a reimbursement. One commenter wrote that it would cost the company “more in personnel overheads to deal with this stupid billing error, than what it’s worth”, while another explained, “It’s an automated system, mate. Just relax.”The moral of the story is that most companies rely on automated billing scripts, and without sensible thresholds, they’ll dutifully produce statements for even the most trivial amounts.In practice, if you owe 99 cents or less, many companies apply a credit adjustment and report a zero balance. The banking industry has recognized that goodwill and efficiency outweigh the pennies left on the ledger. If major financial institutions can swallow a dollar, cloud platforms with higher margins can too.What this taught me and how I’ve been guilty tooAs someone who deploys systems and manages mail servers, I can’t throw stones without acknowledging my own missteps. Earlier this year, I built dewedda.com, a storm‑watch website for the Eastern Caribbean. Part of which was to send automatic email alerts to subscribers when storms approached islands within specific distances and directions.In testing, everything looked great: the algorithm computed wind fields, adjusted for intensity, and tracked dozens of scenarios. But the first time a real storm approached, my code started hammering subscribers with unnecessary alerts. It didn’t account for storms that curved away or systems that were still unnamed, resulting in duplicates, so people kept receiving warnings even when there was no threat or duplicate emails. I had to scramble to adjust the logic.The experience taught me humility and the importance of edge cases, and it makes me more sympathetic to DigitalOcean’s engineers. Building resilient billing and notification systems is complex. Edge cases arise when accounts straddle billing cycles, use promotional credits, or move between team and personal billing. Legacy code and third‑party integrations can behave unpredictably. What matters is how we learn from these events.Conclusion (yes, I paid that one cent)I paid the 1 cent balance owed to DigitalOcean. But who covers that transaction cost?In the end, I did what any responsible business owner would do: I logged into my account and paid the one‑cent balance. Because, it would sit there for months, I only used a droplet for ~1 hour to test something. My personal DigitalOcean account goes mostly unused. So paying this invoice also means no recurring emails to pay my bill. Maybe that’s their plan? Ha!I hope this article highlights the hidden inefficiencies that creep into automation, whether it’s cloud invoices, marketing emails, or storm alerts.I still recommend DigitalOcean to friends and clients. They offer a great product at a fair price, with transparent billing. Being able to spin up a droplet in a few seconds makes life easy for Linux nerds like me. This one‑cent episode doesn’t change that; it simply underscores the value of thoughtful notification design. There are no affiliate links in this post either.In summary, as repeatedly proven, sending fewer, more relevant notifications improves user satisfaction and retention. The environmental data also shows that unnecessary emails carry hidden costs, and financial industry practices demonstrate that forgiving tiny balances can be cheaper than collecting them.A bit of humor on a Saturday morning turned into a lesson for all of us on building better systems. And yes, just in case the automated script is listening, I can confirm that as of writing this, my DigitalOcean account balance is zero.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GHC now runs in the browser</title><link>https://discourse.haskell.org/t/ghc-now-runs-in-your-browser/13169</link><author>kaycebasques</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 16:29:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[thanks for the reports! a few seconds of freeze during start-time is expected, since it needs to download ~50M of a rootfs tarball and extract it, then link the ghc library and all its dependencies. as for safari, it’s strange since i i just landed a workaround for a webkit bug that breaks the wasm dynamic linker a few days ago, i’ll take a closer look later.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Convex Optimization (or Mathematical Programming) in Go</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1ols1gn/convex_optimization_or_mathematical_programming/</link><author>/u/RobotCyclist23</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 16:23:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you write a lot of Convex (or similar) Optimization problems and have been yearning for a way to model them in Go?

Now, these aren’t “caused” by AI; I’m not referring to hoaxes that people have used AI specifically to spread, but things that AI has made worse by the ease with which fake information can be made to look very, very real.Fifteen years ago, this problem existed, but in my opinion, was severely muted. The concept of biased news is not new by any means and has been an issue for as long as the news has existed. There have always been audiences that are more susceptible to believing in these invented stories, scenarios, and scams, and the media has always catered to them, guiding them to the water they wish them to drink. \
My concern, and reason for this brain dump, is that with AI, these evil parties seem to be able to cast a much wider net than they could before. They can twist real news into something it’s not with fake videos made by AI; they can pump the internet full of AI-generated content that says whatever they want and cites other AI-generated sources, and they can mobilize an army of influencers that spread their filth like wildfire in an instant.\
I’ve found that recently, a huge chunk of my time when consuming any form of media is spent asking, “Is this real?” I consistently have to find multiple sources and manually scan them, looking for clues that it was AI-generated, a task that is getting harder and harder by the week. The videos are getting more realistic, the content is written better, and the sources I'm used to relying on are less and less trustworthy.A group of protestors (in this case, trolls) showed up at Chicago’s Bean with claims that there was a man trapped inside. The protestors claimed that they had found evidence that a wealth of life-support systems had been purchased during the making of the Bean statue, and also attempted to make a connection to a potential missing person (a baby, I believe) around the time of its construction. Trolls exist. They always have and always will. That’s not the issue at hand here. The issue is what happened next. This group was clearly trying to be funny, just causing a stir with some radical idea for their own amusement, but the internet used AI to take the country by storm.\
While scrolling, I started to see dozens of videos with screenshots of these purchase records, x-ray footage of a person floating inside the Bean, and “eyewitness” reports from someone who claimed they could hear knocking or scratching coming from inside the structure. There were also videos of the Bean being constructed, where you could clearly see the equipment being placed inside. Most, if not all, of these were generated by AI and are completely fake. I knew this, being a sensible human, but I had to admit that the quality created compelling evidence. With less common sense, I would have been easily duped.The recent discovery of 3I/ATLAS has been a goldmine for AI generators and the conspiracy-loving masses. From what I could find, which wasn’t much because it seems a lot of this information is being controlled to stop the spread of disinformation, all we know is that a comet is passing through our solar system. This comet looks like a comet and acts like a comet, but is slightly faster and is not orbiting our sun. One scientist ventured a challenge to the “it’s just a comet” consensus to encourage more critical thinking, theorizing that it was, of course, possible for it to be an alien craft. This set the AI-loving conspiracy nuts on fire.\
My Instagram feed was on absolute fire with fake videos of this comet with lights being emitted from the sides like a ship, with exhaust clearly venting into space, and fake X-ray shots that showed the internal ship structure and beings inside. Countless videos of influencers pretended to be experts on the matter and talked about potential alien invasions. The worst part of all of this was that each one cited different sources and pulled from different video content. It was easy to assume that a “potential alien invasion” was fake; however, I have to admit, the video content they provided was stunningly believable. The “experts” talking were confident and had plenty of “research” to back them up.\
The most alarming thing about this entire situation is how fast this misinformation is able to spread and how absolutely believable it can make it. I know this isn’t a controlled situation, and we’ve always had irresponsible people running social media accounts to susceptible individuals, but the use of AI in these fields is making the problem more abundant and harder to discern.It’s not all bad… but it’s pretty bad.AI is a wonderful tool that has the potential to make our lives easier. I don’t believe that it is ready for constant use yet, despite it being shoved down our throats around every turn. It consistently hallucinates and makes false claims; it slows my work down more than it speeds it up, and has become a barrier to productivity in most situations I’ve tried to use it. \
However, I can admit it has potential, and there are small automation tasks that I do find small uses for it. That being said, there’s always going to be a heated conversation around ethics and how we should be using AI. \
I don’t believe there will be any disagreement, however, that the above cases are the wrong way to use AI. The use of AI to generate content to fuel conspiracy theories and spread them to the masses as facts is dangerous and, frankly, terrifying. I believe we’re only seeing the tip of the iceberg, and I worry that we’re headed for a future where we’ll no longer be able to discern the difference between truth and fiction.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Security Holes Found in OpenAI&apos;s ChatGPT Atlas Browser (and Perplexity&apos;s Comet)</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/11/01/054213/security-holes-found-in-openais-chatgpt-atlas-browser-and-perplexitys-comet?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 15:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The address bar/ChatGPT input window in OpenAI's browser ChatGPT Atlas "could be targeted for prompt injection using malicious instructions disguised as links," reports SC World, citing a report from AI/agent security platform NeuralTrust:

NeuralTrust found that a malformed URL could be crafted to include a prompt that is treated as plain text by the browser, passing the prompt on to the LLM. A malformation, such as an extra space after the first slash following "https:" prevents the browser from recognizing the link as a website to visit. Rather than triggering a web search, as is common when plain text is submitted to a browser's address bar, ChatGPT Atlas treats plain text as ChatGPT prompts by default. 

An unsuspecting user could potentially be tricked into copying and pasting a malformed link, believing they will be sent to a legitimate webpage. An attacker could plant the link behind a "copy link" button so that the user might not notice the suspicious text at the end of the link until after it is pasted and submitted. These prompt injections could potentially be used to instruct ChatGPT to open a new tab to a malicious website such as a phishing site, or to tell ChatGPT to take harmful actions in the user's integrated applications or logged-in sites like Google Drive, NeuralTrust said. 

Last month browser security platform LayerX also described how malicious prompts could be hidden in URLs (as a parameter) for Perplexity's browser Comet. And last week SquareX Labs demonstrated that a malicious browser extension could spoof Comet's AI sidebar feature and have since replicated the proof-of-concept (PoC) attack on Atlas. 



But another new vulnerability in ChatGPT Atlas "could allow malicious actors to inject nefarious instructions into the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered assistant's memory and run arbitrary code," reports The Hacker News, citing a report from browser security platform LayerX:



"This exploit can allow attackers to infect systems with malicious code, grant themselves access privileges, or deploy malware," LayerX Security Co-Founder and CEO, Or Eshed, said in a report shared with The Hacker News. The attack, at its core, leverages a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) flaw that could be exploited to inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT's persistent memory. The corrupted memory can then persist across devices and sessions, permitting an attacker to conduct various actions, including seizing control of a user's account, browser, or connected systems, when a logged-in user attempts to use ChatGPT for legitimate purposes.... 

"What makes this exploit uniquely dangerous is that it targets the AI's persistent memory, not just the browser session," Michelle Levy, head of security research at LayerX Security, said. "By chaining a standard CSRF to a memory write, an attacker can invisibly plant instructions that survive across devices, sessions, and even different browsers. In our tests, once ChatGPT's memory was tainted, subsequent 'normal' prompts could trigger code fetches, privilege escalations, or data exfiltration without tripping meaningful safeguards...." 


LayerX said the problem is exacerbated by ChatGPT Atlas' lack of robust anti-phishing controls, the browser security company said, adding it leaves users up to 90% more exposed than traditional browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. In tests against over 100 in-the-wild web vulnerabilities and phishing attacks, Edge managed to stop 53% of them, followed by Google Chrome at 47% and Dia at 46%. In contrast, Perplexity's Comet and ChatGPT Atlas stopped only 7% and 5.8% of malicious web pages. 

From The Conversation:

Sandboxing is a security approach designed to keep websites isolated and prevent malicious code from accessing data from other tabs. The modern web depends on this separation. But in Atlas, the AI agent isn't malicious code — it's a trusted user with permission to see and act across all sites. This undermines the core principle of browser isolation.

Science can deal with God in at least three ways: showing how God is not necessary; showing how God is likely; not relating to God at all. Is only one way best? Atheists claim that scientific explanation eliminates for a ‘God of the gaps’. Theists point to the beauty of mathematics and the cosmos all resulting in human sentience and experience.

The process of training a model on new, specific knowledge like internal company documents or a complex reasoning task is notoriously expensive, time-consuming, and fraught with pitfalls. We want smaller, more efficient models that can master a domain without the compute budget of a tech giant.\
The core idea behind making smaller models smarter is a concept called "distillation." In this process, a smaller "student" model learns from a larger, more capable "teacher" model. The student doesn't just learn from a static textbook of examples; it learns to mimic the teacher's thought process. This is a powerful shortcut for transferring expertise.\
Until now, however, engineers have faced a frustrating trade-off. One approach, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL), forces the student to learn from its own mistakes, which is relevant but painfully slow. The alternative, off-policy distillation, is much faster but dangerously flawed; the student learns from the teacher's ideal examples, which often occur in contexts the student will never encounter on its own, causing errors to compound. This has been the bottleneck for creating specialized AI; until now.\
A powerful technique called "on-policy distillation" combines the best of both worlds. By having a teacher model provide dense, token-by-token feedback on the student model's own attempts, we can achieve breakthroughs in training efficiency and capability. Here are the four most surprising and impactful takeaways from this approach.A Smarter Feedback Loop Makes AI Training Up to 100x CheaperThe fundamental difference between Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Distillation lies in the density of the feedback. To understand this, imagine learning to play chess. is like learning chess by only being told if you won or lost at the very end of a match. The feedback is directly related to your actions, but it's sparse. You know you lost, but you don't know if it was because of your opening, a mid-game blunder, or a weak endgame. is like watching a grandmaster play. You observe brilliant moves, but they are made in complex board positions that you, as a novice, will rarely find yourself in. The feedback is dense, but the context is often irrelevant to your own learning path. provides the best of both worlds. It's like having an expert coach who grades every single one of your moves in your own games, telling you if a move was a "blunder," "inaccuracy," or "brilliant." The feedback is both dense and perfectly relevant to your current skill level.\
This smarter feedback loop has a massive impact on efficiency. In a direct back-to-back comparison where a student model learned from a teacher trained via RL, on-policy distillation allowed the student to reach the teacher's performance level 7-10 times faster in terms of gradient steps. This translates to a staggering 50-100x improvement in cumulative compute efficiency.\
The reason for this dramatic speedup is that on-policy distillation provides more useful information (more "bits per episode") for the model to learn from. Because this dense, token-level feedback reduces gradient noise, it allows for training with shorter contexts and smaller, more efficient batch sizes, further slashing the overall computational cost.You Can Cure “AI Amnesia” When Teaching New KnowledgeA common and frustrating problem in AI is "catastrophic forgetting." When you take a pre-trained model and fine-tune it on new, specialized information (like your company's internal knowledge base), it often degrades or completely forgets its original, general-purpose skills, such as the ability to follow instructions.\
Consider an experiment to create an "internal assistant." Researchers started with the Qwen3-8B model, which had a strong instruction-following score of 85%. After fine-tuning it on a 70-30 mix of internal company documents and general chat data:Its knowledge about the documents improved significantly (from 18% to 36% on a QA evaluation).However, its instruction-following skill degraded badly, dropping from 85% down to 79%.\
The solution was a brief phase of on-policy distillation after the initial fine-tuning. By using the original version of the model as the teacher, researchers could restore the lost behavior. The results were powerful:Instruction-following performance was almost fully recovered, jumping back up to 83%.Crucially, this happened without losing the newly acquired knowledge. In fact, the knowledge score even improved slightly to 41%.\
This finding is a game-changer for "continual learning," aka the ability to update models with new information over time without having to perform expensive, full-scale retraining from scratch. It provides a reliable way to teach an AI new facts without it forgetting its core skills.An AI Can Master a Reasoning Skill From Just One ExampleThis finding is highly counterintuitive. In most AI training methods, repeatedly training a model on the exact same prompt is a recipe for failure; the model simply memorizes the answer instead of learning the underlying skill.\
However, an experiment with on-policy distillation turned this assumption on its head. Researchers trained a student model on a math reasoning task using only a single, randomly chosen prompt. They trained on this one prompt for 20 consecutive steps, each with a batch of 256 rollouts, generating 5,120 total learning sequences.\
The remarkable outcome turns conventional wisdom on its head: the student model was able to approximately match the performance of the expert teacher model on the AIME'24 math benchmark, despite only ever having seen that one problem.\
This works because on-policy distillation teaches the model to approximate the teacher's entire thought process; its full probability distribution for what the next best token should be at every step, rather than just memorizing a final answer. This means that for certain skills, the bottleneck isn't finding thousands of examples, but creating a single, perfectly-guided learning experience.Why "Practicing" on Its Own Samples Can Make an AI DumberIt seems logical that if a model produces a high-quality output, you could feed that output back into its training data to reinforce good behavior. This method, known as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on on-policy data, is like having the model "practice" on its own best work.\
But researchers found the opposite to be true. When they trained a model using a dataset composed of its own samples, its performance on an instruction-following evaluation actually degraded.\
The technical reason for this failure is subtle but critical. While the dataset of the model's own outputs might be perfectly on-policy on average, every finite batch of data exhibits a slightly different distribution. Training on these batches causes the model’s internal policy to drift away from its original state. This process turns training on its own samples into a form of off-policy training over time, leading to the same compounding error and divergence seen in other flawed methods.\
In contrast, on-policy distillation is completely stable in this self-distillation scenario. Because the teacher model remains a fixed, consistent target, the student can robustly converge on the desired behavior without degrading. This further cements on-policy distillation as a superior and more reliable tool for behavior refinement and continual learning.The Future of AI is Smaller, Faster, and More PersonalOn-policy distillation is more than just another training technique; it's a foundational shift in how we create specialized, expert AI. By combining the direct relevance of learning from one's own actions with the incredible efficiency of dense, token-by-token feedback, it solves some of the biggest challenges in applied AI.\
The benefits are clear: massive compute savings, a cure for catastrophic forgetting, and unbelievable data efficiency. This is a key enabling technology that lowers the barrier to entry, unlocking the ability for more teams to build and maintain custom models that possess deep domain knowledge without sacrificing core capabilities. This democratization of expert AI will fuel new business models and create competitive advantages previously reserved for frontier labs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China’s Rare Earth Chokehold!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q95xzDQUxzI</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/q95xzDQUxzI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 15:00:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[👉🏻 To try everything Brilliant has to offer for free for a full 30 days, visit https://brilliant.org/patrick/.

But MIT physicists have unveiled a groundbreaking alternative that "used the atom's own electrons as probes to momentarily enter the nucleus..."



In research published in Science, a team of MIT physicists achieved exceptionally precise measurements of the energy of electrons orbiting a radium atom that had been chemically bonded with a fluoride atom to form radium monofluoride. By studying these molecules, the researchers created a kind of miniature particle collider. Within this environment, the electrons surrounding the radium atom were confined closely enough to occasionally slip into the nucleus before returning to their usual orbits... When those electrons returned to their outer paths, they retained the altered energy, effectively carrying a "message" from within the nucleus that could be decoded to reveal its internal arrangement... 

[The researchers] trapped and cooled the molecules and sent them through a system of vacuum chambers, into which they also sent lasers, which interacted with the molecules. In this way, the researchers were able to precisely measure the energies of electrons inside each molecule. When the researchers analyzed their measurements, they noticed that the electrons carried slightly different energies than expected if they had remained outside the nucleus. The difference was incredibly small, only about one millionth of the energy of the laser photon used to excite the molecules, but it was clear evidence that the electrons had entered the radium nucleus and interacted with its protons and neutrons... 

The researchers plan to use this new technique to create a detailed map of how forces are distributed inside the nucleus... to chart the nucleus with greater precision and search for possible violations of fundamental symmetries in nature. 

"It is thought that additional sources of fundamental symmetry violation are required to explain the almost complete absence of antimatter in our universe," the article points out. "Such violations could be seen within the nuclei of certain atoms such as radium... 


"Unlike most atomic nuclei, which are spherical in shape, the radium atom's nucleus has a more asymmetrical configuration, similar to a pear. Scientists predict that this pear shape could significantly enhance their ability to sense the violation of fundamental symmetries, to the extent that they may be potentially observable."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pope declares St. John Henry Newman doctor of the church; AP explains</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gWw6mMlmVU</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0gWw6mMlmVU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 14:29:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Only 37 other people have been given the title “doctor” in the 2,000-year history of the Catholic Church.

As software scales, so does the energy it consumes and the emissions it generates.This growing footprint forms what many engineers now call carbon debt: the accumulation of energy waste caused by inefficient architecture, redundant compute, or neglected cleanup.The problem isn’t limited to theory anymore. Global data workloads are rising faster than the efficiency gains meant to offset them, and few teams have the tools to measure what their systems actually emit.Because engineers control how and where code runs, real progress starts inside development workflows, not in boardrooms.As carbon visibility moves closer to the code itself, software projects may soon be judged not only by speed and stability, but by how responsibly they use the power behind them.Teams talk about technical debt every sprint. They track code smells, refactoring needs, module complexity, and build bloat. But almost no one tracks the energy drain built into their systems, and this makes that blind spot real.\
Every inefficiency in code, like extra loops, redundant database fetches, and idle background tasks, translates into power use. Run thousands or millions of times per day, and what feels trivial becomes measurable emissions. Researchers have begun quantifying this: for example, the Green Algorithms framework shows that compute time, memory usage, and data center efficiency can be converted into carbon equivalent estimates for any computational task.\
At the data center scale, inefficiencies amplify. One white-paper found that servers may draw 60% to 90% of their peak power even while idle. Multiply that across dozens of servers, and weeks of wasted cycles become dozens of kilograms of CO2 equivalent.\
Every product team now operates with an invisible balance sheet, one that records carbon alongside complexity.The term carbon debt originates in environmental accounting, where it describes the accumulated emissions a system or entity has “borrowed” against future budgets with insufficient offsets. (It’s rooted in the broader notion of ecological or climate debt.) Now, technologists are borrowing that phrase to describe software systems whose inefficiencies accrue hidden energy costs over time.\
In software, carbon debt grows when layers of redundant code, over-provisioned infrastructure, and heavy frameworks persist unchecked. A module that spawns unnecessary background jobs, or a service that overfetches data, burns CPU cycles, which burn power.\
When infrastructure is sized with generous headroom “just in case,” that slack often stays underutilized, yet still draws baseline power. Servers and services often draw between 27% and 36% of peak power even under light load.\
As your system advances with more users, more services, and more replicas, each inefficiency multiplies. What once was a single wasted cycle becomes thousands per second. That energy waste endures unless addressed, compounding like interest owed on an invisible balance.\
Next, we’ll trace how code builds up emissions so you can see where the debt really comes from.How Code Accrues EmissionsThe energy footprint of software often hides in the smallest details of its logic. A loop that runs one step too long or a recursive function that never terminates efficiently can keep processors active far longer than needed. Each extra millisecond of compute draws power, and the effect multiplies when thousands of users trigger the same function at once.How Tiny Loops Turn Into Big CostsResearch on mobile software shows that energy code smells can dramatically increase consumption, and in some cases, they can consume up to 87x more energy than clean versions. Follow-up work found that fixing these patterns delivered 4% to 30% efficiency gains in practice. These results reinforce the broader point: repetitive, seemingly minor patterns accumulate real power draw over time.\
Similar waste appears in everyday engineering habits: redundant database queries, unnecessary front-end re-renders, and dormant API endpoints all keep processors active, drawing power without improving performance.\
Over-sized build artifacts and idle background tasks deepen the impact by holding memory and storage resources active long after they’re useful. When these patterns run across millions of daily transactions, the emissions scale from grams to kilograms of CO2. Quantifying that footprint is the next challenge, and few teams yet have the tools to do it precisely.Measuring What We Don’t SeeTracking how much energy software really uses is harder than it sounds. The Software Carbon Intensity (SCI) framework from the Green Software Foundation is one of the first real attempts to make that measurable, like mapping compute time, memory use, and data transfer against actual energy data.\
Tools such as Cloud Carbon Footprint and CodeCarbon are now taking that formula a step further, embedding energy estimates directly into build pipelines and dashboards so developers can see environmental impact alongside performance metrics. This aligns with broader conversations inside the DevOps community, where teams are beginning to explore practical ways to embed sustainability into build and deployment workflows.\
The challenge is translating code execution into physical terms. Every watt drawn depends on processor type, cooling efficiency, and the carbon intensity of the grid that powers the data center. The same workload might have a fraction of the emissions on renewable-heavy infrastructure compared to fossil-fueled grids.\
The logic behind these tools isn’t far from how predictive analytics is being used to expose hidden operational costs in other industries, turning guesswork into measurable insight. Until this kind of visibility becomes standard in developer environments, most teams will keep optimizing performance while staying blind to the energy behind it.The Governance Gap: Why Carbon Isn’t Yet a Coding MetricSustainability still sits outside most engineering workflows. In many companies, carbon reporting lives with facilities or operations teams, not with the people writing or deploying code.\
As a result, the energy cost of a release is rarely discussed in sprint planning or post-mortems. Agile ceremonies track velocity, story points, and error rates, but not emissions.Few DevOps environments include “carbon sprints” or carbon budgets, even though they could be tracked the same way as uptime or latency. A report based on responses from over 2,000 software practitioners has found that most organizations are still in the early stages of measuring software-related emissions. Others echoed this, noting that sustainability metrics remain largely absent from continuous-integration and delivery pipelines.\
That gap is beginning to close. Some open-source communities have started experimenting with “green commits” to tag energy-efficient changes, and enterprise dashboards are beginning to surface sustainability data next to performance KPIs. As this visibility improves, design priorities are shifting toward decay and restraint by building systems that know when to slow down, scale back, or shut off entirely.Designing for Decay: Making Efficiency a DefaultArchitects concerned with long-lived systems often speak of architectural erosion or design decay, like the gradual divergence between intended structure and runtime reality. Architecture erosion is a well-known risk in systems as features accumulate and shortcuts proliferate. One way to counter that drift is to build systems that self-optimize or sunset unused processes automatically, pruning inactive modules or trimming underutilized services based on real usage signals.Treating code decay as a feature means embedding routines that perform periodic cleanup: archiving stale APIs, retiring dormant modules, or enforcing dependency hygiene. Frameworks may require that libraries unused for X releases be flagged or removed. Over time, the shift moves from “unlimited scaling” toward sustainable scaling, systems designed to shrink or sleep when load is low rather than running flat out forever.\
Engineers can use runtime profiling, build monitoring, and garbage-collection heat maps as signals. If a microservice’s CPU utilization stays near zero for weeks, it raises a refactor or archive flag. If build artifacts grow without change, they are flagged for pruning.\
This philosophy sets the stage for what’s next: making carbon visibility part of everyday decision-making, and bringing engineering metrics and emissions metrics into the same ecosystem.The Road to Carbon TransparencyImagine an IDE where each file, function, or commit carries a live “emissions counter”; you write a loop, and you see how much energy it might cost. That’s the direction software tooling is heading. Build tools could come to flag carbon-heavy changes before they’re merged.\
CI/CD pipelines will evolve to flag carbon-intensive builds, perhaps even rejecting code that spikes emissions far above baseline. With tighter integration, carbon metrics will merge with performance dashboards, showing build time, throughput, and CO2 cost in one pane.Cloud Dashboards & Deployment TransparencyCloud providers may expose per-deployment carbon cost insights, mapping workload emissions to regions, instance types, and schedules. The same principle underpins the idea of carbon-aware computing, where workloads shift dynamically to regions or times with cleaner grids. Integrating that into the same console where devs monitor CPU, bandwidth, and billing makes sustainability part of everyday trade-offs.\
With visibility in place, engineers will begin to optimize not just for latency or memory, but for carbon as a first-class metric. Those insights will shape budgeting decisions, drive architecture choices (edge, serverless, off-peak scheduling), and enforce sustainable defaults in code.\
Ahead lies a time when your pull request comes with a carbon delta and teams judge changes not only by correctness or performance, but by how much energy they add or save.Engineering AccountabilitySustainability in software doesn’t start in a server farm, but it starts at the keyboard. Every query, commit, and deployment decision shapes the energy profile of the systems we run. For years, efficiency meant speed and uptime, and now it also means restraint.\
Across the industry, teams are beginning to treat carbon debt the same way they treat technical debt: as something that compounds if ignored. Cleaning up unused code, right-sizing infrastructure, or pausing idle jobs are no longer side tasks; they’re acts of maintenance that protect performance and the planet.\
As tooling matures, carbon visibility will become part of normal governance, sitting next to reliability and security in every build report. The responsibility won’t rest with operations alone but with every engineer who touches code. Because in modern software, clean code and clean energy belong to the same conversation, and writing one well means caring about the other.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Go: Can It Mitigate Supply Chain Attacks?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/go-can-it-mitigate-supply-chain-attacks?source=rss</link><author>Go [Technical Documentation]</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 14:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern software engineering is collaborative, and based on reusing Open Source software. That exposes targets to supply chain attacks, where software projects are attacked by compromising their dependencies.\
Despite any process or technical measure, every dependency is unavoidably a trust relationship. However, the Go tooling and design help mitigate risk at various stages.There is no way for changes in the outside world—such as a new version of a dependency being published—to automatically affect a Go build.\
Unlike most other package managers files, Go modules don’t have a separate list of constraints and a lock file pinning specific versions. The version of every dependency contributing to any Go build is fully determined by the  file of the main module.\
Since Go 1.16, this determinism is enforced by default, and build commands (, , , , …) will fail if the go.mod is incomplete. The only commands that will change the  (and therefore the build) are  and . These commands are not expected to be run automatically or in CI, so changes to dependency trees must be made deliberately and have the opportunity to go through code review.\
This is very important for security, because when a CI system or new machine runs , the checked-in source is the ultimate and complete source of truth for what will get built. There is no way for third parties to affect that.\
Moreover, when a dependency is added with , its transitive dependencies are added at the version specified in the dependency’s  file, not at their latest versions, thanks to Minimal version selection. The same happens for invocations of go install example.com/cmd/devtoolx@latest, the equivalents of which in some ecosystems bypass pinning. In Go, the latest version of  will be fetched, but then all the dependencies will be set by its  file.\
If a module gets compromised and a new malicious version is published, no one will be affected until they explicitly update that dependency, providing the opportunity to review the changes and time for the ecosystem to detect the event.Version contents never changeAnother key property necessary to ensure third parties can’t affect builds is that the contents of a module version are immutable. If an attacker that compromises a dependency could re-upload an existing version, they could automatically compromise all projects that depend on it.\
That’s what the  file is for. It contains a list of cryptographic hashes of each dependency that contributes to the build. Again, an incomplete  causes an error, and only  and  will modify it, so any changes to it will accompany a deliberate dependency change. Other builds are guaranteed to have a full set of checksums.\
This is a common feature of most lock files. Go goes beyond it with the Checksum Database (sumdb for short), a global append-only cryptographically-verifiable list of go.sum entries. When  needs to add an entry to the  file, it fetches it from the sumdb along with cryptographic proof of the sumdb integrity. This ensures that not only every build of a certain module uses the same dependency contents, but that every module out there uses the same dependency contents!\
The sumdb makes it impossible for compromised dependencies or even Google-operated Go infrastructure to target specific dependents with modified (e.g. backdoored) source. You’re guaranteed to be using the exact same code that everyone else who’s using e.g. v1.9.2 of  is using and has reviewed.\
Finally, my favorite features of the sumdb: it doesn’t require any key management on the part of module authors, and it works seamlessly with the decentralized nature of Go modules.The VCS is the source of truthMost projects are developed through some version control system (VCS) and then, in other ecosystems, uploaded to the package repository. This means there are two accounts that could be compromised, the VCS host and the package repository, the latter of which is used more rarely and more likely to be overlooked. It also means it’s easier to hide malicious code in the version uploaded to the repository, especially if the source is routinely modified as part of the upload, for example to minimize it.\
In Go, there is no such thing as a package repository account. The import path of a package embeds the information that needs in order to fetch its module directly from the VCS, where tags define versions.\
We do have the Go Module Mirror, but that’s only a proxy. Module authors don’t register an account and don’t upload versions to the proxy. The proxy uses the same logic that the  tool uses (in fact, the proxy runs ) to fetch and cache a version. Since the Checksum Database guarantees that there can be only one source tree for a given module version, everyone using the proxy will see the same result as everyone bypassing it and fetching directly from the VCS. (If the version is not available anymore in the VCS or if its contents changed, fetching directly will lead to an error, while fetching from the proxy might still work, improving availability and protecting the ecosystem from “left-pad” issues.)\
Running VCS tools on the client exposes a pretty large attack surface. That’s another place the Go Module Mirror helps: the  tool on the proxy runs inside a robust sandbox and is configured to support every VCS tool, while the default is to only support the two major VCS systems (git and Mercurial). Anyone using the proxy can still fetch code published using off-by-default VCS systems, but attackers can’t reach that code in most installations.Building code doesn’t execute itIt is an explicit security design goal of the Go toolchain that neither fetching nor building code will let that code execute, even if it is untrusted and malicious. This is different from most other ecosystems, many of which have first-class support for running code at package fetch time. These “post-install” hooks have been used in the past as the most convenient way to turn a compromised dependency into compromised developer machines, and to worm through module authors.\
To be fair, if you’re fetching some code it’s often to execute it shortly afterwards, either as part of tests on a developer machine or as part of a binary in production, so lacking post-install hooks is only going to slow down attackers. (There is no security boundary within a build: any package that contributes to a build can define an  function.) However, it can be a meaningful risk mitigation, since you might be executing a binary or testing a package that only uses a subset of the module’s dependencies. For example, if you build and execute  on macOS there is no way for a Windows-only dependency or a dependency of example.com/cmd/othertool to compromise your machine.\
In Go, modules that don’t contribute code to a specific build have no security impact on it.“A little copying is better than a little dependency”The final and maybe most important software supply chain risk mitigation in the Go ecosystem is the least technical one: Go has a culture of rejecting large dependency trees, and of preferring a bit of copying to adding a new dependency. It goes all the way back to one of the Go proverbs: “a little copying is better than a little dependency”. The label “zero dependencies” is proudly worn by high-quality reusable Go modules. If you find yourself in need of a library, you’re likely to find it will not cause you to take on a dependency on dozens of other modules by other authors and owners.\
That’s enabled also by the rich standard library and additional modules (the  ones), which provide commonly used high-level building blocks such as an HTTP stack, a TLS library, JSON encoding, etc.\
All together this means it’s possible to build rich, complex applications with just a handful of dependencies. No matter how good the tooling is, it can’t eliminate the risk involved in reusing code, so the strongest mitigation will always be a small dependency tree.\

In this blog post, I will explain how we address these limitations and how developers using SQLite can apply the same solutions.This will be a technical blog post intended for developers and everyone wanting to learn about concurrency.Also Jellyfin's implementation of locking for SQLite should be fairly easy to be implemented into another EF Core application if you are facing the same issue.SQLite is a file-based database engine running within your application and allows you to store data in a relational structure.
Overall it gives your application the means of storing structured data as a single file and without having to depend on another application to do so.
Naturally this also comes at a price. If your application fully manages this file, the assumption must be made that your application is the sole owner of this file, and nobody else will tinker with it while you are writing data to it.So an application that wants to use SQLite as its database needs to be the only one accessing it.
Having established this fact, an important thought arises: if only a single write operation should be performed on a single file at a time, this rule must also apply to operations within the same application.SQLite has a feature that tries to get around this limitation: the Write-Ahead-Log (WAL).
The WAL is a separate file that acts as a journal of operations that should be applied to an SQLite file.
This allows multiple parallel writes to take place and get enqueued into the WAL.
When another part of the application wants to read data, it reads from the actual database, then scans the WAL for modifications and applies them on the fly.
This is not a foolproof solution; there are still scenarios where WAL does not prevent locking conflicts.A transaction is supposed to ensure two things.
Modifications made within a transaction can be reverted, either when something goes wrong or when the application decides it should and optionally a transaction may also block other readers from reading data that is modified within a transaction.
This is where it gets spicy and we come to the real reason why I am writing this blog post.
For some reason on some systems that run Jellyfin when a transaction takes place the SQLite engine reports the database is locked and instead of waiting for the transaction to be resolved the engine refuses to wait and just crashes.
This seems to be a not uncommon issue and there are many reports to be found on the issue.The factor that makes this issue so bad is that it does not happen reliably. So far we only have one team member where this can be (somewhat) reliably be reproduced which makes this an even worse a bug.
From the reports this issue happens across all operating systems, drive speeds and with or without virtualization.
So we do not have any deciding factor identified that even contributes to the likelihood of the issue happening.Having established the general theory on how SQLite behaves, we also have to look at the specifics of Jellyfins usage of SQLite.
During normal operations on a recommended setup (Non-Networked Storage and preferably SSD) its unusual for any problems to arise, however the way Jellyfin utilises the SQLite db up to 10.11 is very suboptimal.
In versions prior to 10.11 Jellyfin had a bug in its parallel task limit which resulted in exponential overscheduling of library scan operations which hammered the database engine with thousands of parallel write requests that an SQLite engine is simply not able to handle.
While most SQLite engine implementations have retry behavior, they also have timeouts and checks in place to prevent limitless waiting so if we stress the engine enough, it just fails with an error.
That and very long running and frankly unoptimized transactions could lead to the database just being overloaded with requests and flaking out.Since we moved the codebase over to EF Core proper, we have the tools to actually do something about this as EF Core gives us a structured abstraction level.
EF Core supports a way of hooking into every command execution or transaction by creating Interceptors.
With an interceptor we can finally do the straight forward idea of just "not" writing to the database in parallel in a transparent way to the caller.
The overall idea is to have multiple strategies of locking. Because all levels of synchronization will inevitably come at the cost of performance, we only want to do it when it is really necessary.
So, I decided on three locking strategies:As a default, the no-lock behavior does exactly what the name implies. Nothing. This is the default because my research shows that for 99% all of this is not an issue and every interaction at this level will slow down the whole application.Both the optimistic and pessimistic behaviors use two interceptors—one for transactions and one for commands—and override  in .Optimistic locking behavior​Optimistic locking means to assume the operation in question will succeed and only handle issues afterwards. In essence this can be boiled down to "Try and Retry and Retry ..." for a set number of times until either we succeed with the operation or fail entirely.
This still leaves the possibility that we will not actually be able to perform a write, but the introduced overhead is far less than the Pessimistic locking behavior.The idea behind how this works is simple: every time two operations try to write to the database, one will always win. The other will fail, wait some time, then retry a few times.Jellyfin uses the  library perform the retry behavior and will only retry operations it will find have been locked due to this exact issue.Pessimistic locking behavior​Pessimistic locking always locks when a write to SQLite should be performed. Essentially every time an transaction is started or a write operation on the database is done though EF Core, Jellyfin will wait until all other read operations are finished and then block all other operations may they be read or write until the write in question has been performed.
This however means, that Jellyfin can only ever perform a single write to the database, even if it would technically does not need to.In theory, an application should have no issue reading from table "Alice" while writing to table "Bob" however to eliminate all possible sources of concurrency related locking, Jellyfin will only ever allow a single write performed on its database in this mode.
While this will absolutely result in the most stable operation, it will undoubtedly also be the slowest.Jellyfin uses a ReaderWriterLockSlim to lock the operations, that means we allow an unlimited number of reads to happen concurrently while only one write may ever be done on the database.The future Smart locking behavior​In the future we might also consider combining both modes, to get the best of both worlds.Initial testing showed that with both modes, we had great success in handling the underlying issue. While we are not yet sure why this happens only on some systems when others work, we at least now have an option for users previously left out of using Jellyfin.When I was researching this topic, I found many reports all over the internet facing the same error but nobody was able to provide a conclusive explanation whats really happening here.
There have been similar proposals made to handle it but there wasn't a "ready to drop in" solution that handles all the different cases or only code that required massive modifications to every EF Core query.
Jellyfin's implementation of the locking behaviors should be a copy-paste solution for everyone having the same issues as its using interceptors and the caller has no idea of the actual locking behavior.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Do you know that there is an HTML tables API?</title><link>https://christianheilmann.com/2025/10/08/abandonware-of-the-web-do-you-know-that-there-is-an-html-tables-api/</link><author>begoon</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 12:58:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[When people turn data into  tables using JavaScript, they either use the  methods (createElement() and the likes), but most of the time just append a huge string and use innerHTML, which always is a security concern. However, did you know that  tables also have an old, forgotten  ? Using this one, you can loop over tables, create bodies, rows, cells, heads, footers, captions an summaries (yes,  tables have all of those) and access the table cells. Without having to re-render the whole table on each change. Check out the Codepen to see how you can create a table from a nested array:let table 
let b  document.
let t  document.
b.t
table.rowri
  let r  t.ri
  row.li
    let c  r.i
    c. llet table = [
  ['one','two','three'],
  ['four','five','six']
];
let b = document.body;
let t = document.createElement('table');
b.appendChild(t);
table.forEach((row,ri) => {
  let r = t.insertRow(ri);
  row.forEach((l,i) => {
    let c = r.insertCell(i);
    c.innerText = l;  
  })
});You can then access each table cell with an index (with t being a reference to the table):console.t..console.log(t.rows[1].cells[1]);
// => <td>five</td>You can also delete and create cells and rows, if you want to add a row to the end of the table with a cell, all you need to do is:t.
t..
t...t.insertRow(-1);
t.rows[2].insertCell(0);
t.rows[2].cells[0].innerText = 'foo';There are a few things here that are odd – adding a -1 to add a row at the end for example – and there seems to be no way to create a TH element instead of a TD. All table cells are just cells.However, seeing how much of a pain it is to create tables, it would be fun to re-visit this  and add more functionality to it. We did add a lot of things to  forms, like formData and the change event, so why not add events and other features to tables. That way they’d finally get the status as data structures and not a hack to layout content on the web.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The bridge to the dead allowing Venetians to visit loved ones&apos; graves on Day of the Dead</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGKXkYZkEPo</link><author>Associated Press</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mGKXkYZkEPo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 12:49:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC52X5wxOL_s5yw0dQk7NtgA">News - AP</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A temporary floating bridge once connected Venice to the island of San Michele and its cemetery.

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

Summers agrees with Fed Chair Powell’s reluctance to lock in a December rate cut. And, with new congressional momentum and a victory in midterm elections, Argentina’s President Javier Milei gets the electorate’s buy-in to continue economic reforms that have had mixed results. Plus, Geoffrey Hinton, the “Godfather of AI,” warns that the race to build smarter machines is outpacing efforts to control them, and that humanity must act before it’s too late. Later, will President Trump’s $100,000 H-1B visa fee actually solve the issues of misuse and poor pay, or will it starve the US of global talent?

But earlier this month, bureaucrats in charge of federal lands scrapped collective approval for the Esmeralda 7 projects, in what campaigners fear is part of an attack on renewable energy under President Donald Trump. "We will not approve wind or farmer destroying [sic] Solar," he posted on his Truth Social platform in August. Developers will need to reapply individually, slowing progress.
 
Thousands of miles away on the other side of the Pacific Ocean, it is a different story. China has laid solar panels across an area the size of Chicago high up on the Tibetan Plateau, where the thin air helps more sunlight get through. The Talatan Solar Park is part of China's push to double its solar and wind generation capacity over the coming decade. "Green and low-carbon transition is the trend of our time," President Xi Jinping told delegates at a UN summit in New York last month. China's vast production of solar panels and batteries has also pushed down the prices of renewables hardware for everyone else, meaning it has "become very difficult to make any other choice in some places," according to Heymi Bahar, senior analyst at the International Energy Agency. [...]
 
More broadly, the US's focus on fossil fuels and pullback of support for clean energy further cedes influence over the future global energy system to China. The US is trying to tie its trading partners into fossil fuels, pressing the EU to buy $750 billion of American oil, natural gas, and nuclear technologies during his presidency as part of a trade deal, scuppering an initiative to begin decarbonizing world shipping and pressuring others to reduce their reliance on Chinese technology. But the collapsing cost of solar panels in particular has spoken for itself in many parts of the world. Experts caution that the US's attacks on renewables could cause lasting damage to its competitiveness against China, even if an administration more favorable to renewables were to follow Trump's.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Not So Fast: Analyzing the Performance of WebAssembly vs. Native Code (WASM 45% slower)</title><link>https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/1901.09056</link><author>/u/Zomgnerfenigma</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:27:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Challenge of Benchmarking WebAssemblyThe aforementioned suite of 24 benchmarks is the PolybenchC benchmark
suite , which is designed to measure the effect of
polyhedral loop optimizations in compilers. All the benchmarks in the
suite are small scientific computing kernels rather than full
applications (e.g., matrix multiplication and LU Decomposition); each is
roughly 100 LOC. While WebAssembly is designed to accelerate scientific
kernels on the Web, it is also explicitly designed for a much richer set
of full applications.The WebAssembly documentation highlights several intended use
cases , including scientific kernels, image editing,
video editing, image recognition, scientific visualization, simulations,
programming language interpreters, virtual machines, and POSIX applications.
Therefore, WebAssembly’s strong performance on the scientific kernels in PolybenchC
do not imply that it will perform well given a different kind of application.We argue that a more comprehensive evaluation of WebAssembly should rely on an
established benchmark suite of large programs, such as the SPEC CPU benchmark
suites. In fact, the SPEC CPU 2006 and 2017 suite of
benchmarks include several applications that fall under the intended use cases of
WebAssembly: eight benchmarks are scientific applications (e.g., ,
, , , and
), two benchmarks involve image and video processing
( and ), and all of the benchmarks are POSIX
applications.Unfortunately, it is not possible to simply compile a sophisticated
native program to WebAssembly. Native programs, including the programs in
the SPEC CPU suites, require operating system services, such as a
filesystem, synchronous I/O, and processes, which WebAssembly and the
browser do not provide. The SPEC benchmarking harness itself requires
a file system, a shell, the ability to spawn processes, and other Unix
facilities. To overcome these limitations when porting native
applications to the web, many programmers painstakingly modify their
programs to avoid or mimic missing operating system
services. Modifying well-known benchmarks, such as SPEC CPU, would not
only be time consuming but would also pose a serious threat to
validity.The standard approach to running these applications today is to use
Emscripten, a toolchain for compiling C and C++ to
WebAssembly . Unfortunately, Emscripten only supports
the most trivial system calls and does not scale up to large-scale
applications. For example, to enable applications to use synchronous
I/O, the default Emscripten  filesystem loads the entire
filesystem image into memory before the program begins executing. For
SPEC, these files are too large to fit into memory.A promising alternative is to use , a framework that enables
running unmodified, full-featured Unix applications in the
browser .  implements
a Unix-compatible kernel in JavaScript, with full support for
processes, files, pipes, blocking I/O, and other Unix features.
Moreover, it includes a C/C++ compiler (based on Emscripten)
that allows programs to run in the browser
unmodified. The  case studies include complex applications,
such as , which runs entirely in the browser without any
source code modifications.Unfortunately,  is a JavaScript-only solution, since it was
built before the release of
WebAssembly. Moreover,  suffers from high performance overhead,
which would be a significant confounder while benchmarking. Using ,
it would be difficult to tease apart the poorly performing benchmarks
from performance degradation introduced by .]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine Destroys Russia’s 400-Km Military Fuel Pipeline in Covert Operation Near Moscow</title><link>https://united24media.com/latest-news/ukraine-destroys-russias-400-km-military-fuel-pipeline-in-covert-operation-near-moscow-13020</link><author>/u/eaglemaxie</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:26:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ukraine’s Main Directorate of Intelligence (HUR) has carried out a special operation that disabled Russia’s “Koltsovoy” fuel pipeline—a 400-kilometer network that supplied gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel to the Russian military. According to HUR, all three lines of the pipeline exploded simultaneously on the evening of October 31 in the Ramensky district near Moscow, rendering the system inoperative.The operation was confirmed by Ukraine’s military intelligence service on November 1. HUR reported that despite anti-drone defenses and armed security protecting the facility, “all three lines used to transport gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel were successfully and simultaneously destroyed.”The “Koltsovoy” pipeline served as a critical logistical link between several Russian refineries and military storage facilities. According to HUR, the system received fuel from refineries in Ryazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Moscow, and had an annual capacity of up to 3 million tons of jet fuel, 2.8 million tons of diesel, and 1.6 million tons of gasoline. Russian emergency and security services reportedly arrived at the scene soon after the explosions, but the damage has left the infrastructure inoperable.HUR chief Kyrylo Budanov previously noted that Ukraine’s precision strikes on Russian logistics infrastructure had already inflicted greater losses on the Kremlin’s war machine than international sanctions. “In reality, our strikes have had more impact than sanctions,” Budanov said earlier this year. “It’s simply a mathematical truth.”Earlier, Ukraine’s Security Service (SBU) and HUR carried out a covert operation that destroyed one of Russia’s top-secret “Oreshnik” strategic missile systems at the Kapustin Yar test range. According to SBU chief Vasyl Malyuk, it was a “100% successful strike,” personally overseen by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew had &apos;40 prostitutes brought to five-star Thailand hotel room&apos; during four-day taxpayer funded trip, author claims</title><link>https://www.lbc.co.uk/article/andrew-prostitutes-thailand-trip-5HjdGCQ_2/</link><author>/u/esporx</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 09:20:51 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor had 40 prostitutes brought to his five-star hotel during a four-day trip to Thailand, the disgraced royal’s unauthorised biographer has claimed. 
Royal historian Andrew Lownie has alleged the disgraced former prince went on a string of taxpayer-funded trips which doubled up as holidays amid his “midlife crisis" in the early 2000s. It came after his brother, then-Prince Charles, reportedly advised against giving Andrew the Trade Envoy role in 2001 as he would just “chase women and play golf”.“In 2001, Andrew is 41, he's having his midlife crisis and he basically starts chasing lots and lots of women," Mr Lonie told the Daily Mail’s Deep Dive: The Fall of the House of York podcast. “He uses the excuse of his role as Trade Envoy, paid for by the taxpayer, to go off on these trips." He added: “He always puts in two weeks of ‘private time’. So, we pay for his holiday and then he goes off and does things.Where will Andrew live after being kicked out of Royal Lodge?Beatrice and Eugenie quietly left UK while Andrew was being stripped of titles“There was a famous trip to Thailand - for the birthday celebrations of the King. Andrew is representing his country and insists on staying in a five-star hotel rather than the embassy, which he always did.“Andrew had 40 prostitutes brought in the space of four days. This was all enabled by diplomats and others.”The historian claimed this figure has been verified by multiple sources, including a member of Thailand's royal family.Ian Proud, who headed up the political branch of the UK embassy in Thailand, has said the royal’s promiscuous behaviour was common knowledge among staff."He also came out on private trips to see his bits of fluff on the side, where we played a much lighter role in stewarding him through," he told the Metro. He added Andrew liked to have his own private space when he was on business and preferred not to stay in the embassy itself."When I was there he preferred a particular high end hotel because he liked the nightclub in the basement there with the floozies and so on," Mr Proud said.Andrew’s fall from grace continued rapidly this morning as he was swiftly removed from the Official Roll of the Peerage, the public record of peers and peerages of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom.The development marks a key step in formally removing his titles. Dukes, including the Duke of York, are listed on the roll of the peerage maintained at the Crown Office.As Lord Chancellor, David Lammy is responsible for maintaining the peerage roll. Andrew is still eighth in line to the throne behind Prince William, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Prince Harry, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet.The only way Andrew could be removed from the line of succession would be through an Act of Parliament, but it would also require the consent of all other Commonwealth realms.Buckingham Palace said Andrew has agreed to leave the Windsor residence as his links to paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein continue to cause controversy.It is understood that although Andrew denies the accusations, Buckingham Palace considers the friendship a “serious lapses of judgment”.A statement released by the Palace on Thursday evening said: "His Majesty has today initiated a formal process to remove the Style, Titles and Honours of Prince Andrew."Prince Andrew will now be known as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You can&apos;t refuse to be scanned by ICE&apos;s facial recognition app, DHS document say</title><link>https://www.404media.co/you-cant-refuse-to-be-scanned-by-ices-facial-recognition-app-dhs-document-says/</link><author>nh43215rgb</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 08:58:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Photos captured by Mobile Fortify will be stored for 15 years, regardless of immigration or citizenship status, the document says.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Child abductions rampant in northern Nigeria, but one girl is reunited with her mother | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/DqMlSDXVsUU</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DqMlSDXVsUU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 08:45:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Salamatu Zubair’s world shattered when her 4-year-old was abducted in April 2025.

I plan to introduce hard Rust dependencies and Rust code into
APT, no earlier than May 2026. This extends at first to the
Rust compiler and standard library, and the Sequoia ecosystem.

In particular, our code to parse .deb, .ar, .tar, and the
HTTP signature verification code would strongly benefit
from memory safe languages and a stronger approach to
unit testing.

If you maintain a port without a working Rust toolchain,
please ensure it has one within the next 6 months, or
sunset the port.

It's important for the project as whole to be able to
move forward and rely on modern tools and technologies
and not be held back by trying to shoehorn modern software
on retro computing devices.

Thank you for your understanding.

Using standard names for things frees up time to work on tougher problems than naming, and means future readers of your code can probably understand the concept better.Why we spend time naming things correctlyIf you see a variable called , you can probably assume it is a boolean.  or  are not clear.Avoid Negative variable names:Negative names can lead to double negatives, which are confusing.Abbreviations can be ambiguous - not everyone will interpret it as the same meaning. Just use the full word, it is clearer.(Although  is probably an exception where it should always be used over ).Pick a language and always use thatIf you work in a modern company then it is likely you work with people originally from various countries around the world. It can be easy to end up with a codebase with a mix of words like  and .I'd recommend just picking US spelling in your code (even if the app is localised only for a UK or AU audiece)Make booleans obvious by using is/has prefixIf you name something , it is quite obvious that it is a boolean. Try to always do this, as something like  could read as if it wasn't a booleanWords like , ,  are too generic. Try to avoid these termsPick a convention for naming things, and use those everywhere.calculateAmountBad 👎:  and Good 👍:  and Also pick a style for casing, and be sure you're consistent with it. Here are some examples (there might be other typical conventions for your library/language of choice) for class names for most other variables for static constantsCommon names for specific thingsIf you're taking some data and  it to a different shape or different values then  is a common and accurate name.If you need to check if data is valid/correct, then its almost always called a validator.Used when describing the shape of some data structure. Often used with database designs.When you need to take some data (e.g. some string) and understand its own data structure. They are quite different things, parsers and transformers can  be very relatedFor code that runs 'between' different parts of your application. A typical use for middleware is in HTTP servers the incoming HTTP request can go through multiple middlewares to either transform the incoming data (before passing to next one or final endpoint handler function) or to do something with that dataWhen you have some functionality with a specific interface, and you need to convert it to another interface/shape.It is also known as a 'wrapper' (or a bridge, although that is technically a slightly different thing)When you need to make data uniform in scale, format, or structure]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kerala becomes first state in India to eradicate extreme poverty</title><link>https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-becomes-1st-state-in-india-to-eradicate-extreme-poverty-chief-minister-announces-in-assembly-2811729-2025-11-01</link><author>/u/captain-price-</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 07:20:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Adding another feather to its cap, Kerala became the first state in India to eradicate extreme poverty. This was announced by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in the state Assembly on Saturday.Vijayan made the announcement in a special session of the House convened on the occasion of Kerala '' or formation day."Today's Kerala Piravi marks a place in history because we have succeeded in making Kerala the first Indian state without extreme poverty. This Legislative Assembly has witnessed many historic laws and policy declarations. The Assembly now meets at a moment that marks yet another milestone in the creation of a Nava Kerala," he said.The Chief Minister said the eradication of extreme poverty was one of the key decisions taken at the first cabinet meeting after the new ministry was sworn in in 2021. "It was also the beginning of fulfilling one of the most important promises made to the people during the Legislative Assembly election," he added.The Congress-led UDF opposition called Vijayan's statements "pure fraud" and boycotted the session in protest.HOW DID KERALA COMBAT EXTREME POVERTY?With an investment of over Rs 1,000 crore, the state government ensured daily food for 20,648 families, with 2,210 of those receiving hot meals, necessary treatment and medicine for 85,721 individuals and housing for thousands.He said more than 5,400 new homes were built or are under construction, 5,522 homes were repaired and 2,713 landless families received land to build their residences.Besides that, 21,263 people received essential documents like ration cards, Aadhaar and pensions for the first time and 4,394 families are supported with livelihood projects, Vijayan had said in a post."Instead of a one-size-fits-all policy, the government identified 64,006 vulnerable families and created specific micro-plans for each one's unique needs," the Chief Minister had added.Local Self-Government Minister MB Rajesh on Friday said Kerala's Extreme Poverty Eradication Programme (EPEP) had been implemented through a transparent and participatory process involving micro-level projects across the state.The minister said the achievement was the result of coordinated efforts that transcended political boundaries, with participation from local bodies under both the LDF and UDF administrations.Slamming the UDF for opposing the government's initiative, Rajesh said, "It is not as if we suddenly decided one fine morning to announce that Kerala is free from extreme poverty."OPPOSITION BOYCOTTS SPECIAL SESSION, VIJAYAN TAKES DIGAs the special Assembly session commenced for the announcement on Kerala being free from extreme poverty, Leader of Opposition VD Satheesan said the Chief Minister's statement was "pure fraud" and in "contempt" of House rules."So, we cannot join in that and are completely boycotting the session," Satheesan said. The opposition then walked out of the House shouting slogans.Responding to the opposition's allegation, Vijayan said the UDF was referring to its own behaviour when they say "fraud". "We only say what we can implement. We have implemented what we had said. That is our reply to the opposition leader," he said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bosnia and Herzegovina: The horse whisperer | Focus on Europe</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEvEHKM5S04</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NEvEHKM5S04?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 07:19:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lamija Džigal-Bektešević protects Bosnian Mountain Horses and offers riding therapy for people with disabilities.

Musk's company has also been linked to two more satellite ventures, which are concerned with relaying sensitive communications and tracing vehicles, respectively.
 
Golden Dome, inspired by Israel's "Iron Dome," was announced by Trump and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth at the White House in May and will amount to a complex system of satellites and weaponry capable of destroying incoming missiles before they hit American targets. The president promised it would be "fully operational" before he leaves office in January 2029, capable of intercepting rockets, "even if they are launched from space," with an overall price tag of $175 billion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tanzania election unrest: A litmus test for President Hassan | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2aqSsamVreo</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2aqSsamVreo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 06:48:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tanzania's government has deployed the military, ordered a curfew in Dar es Salaam amid internet outages after violence broke out on election day.

Microsoft released its latest quarterly earnings report and proved the worst of our fears about its gaming brand. Not only are Xbox hardware sales down significantly, but the brand itself is barely treading water. Gamers are voicing their displeasure with their wallets, but Microsoft's top brass is still only thinking about the margins. Microsoft was more keen to promote the scale of its cloud and AI services revenue -- which was up 28% year over year -- than talk about its beleaguered gaming brand. The company's overall gaming revenue fell by 2% compared to the same time last year. This was precipitated by a "decline in Xbox hardware," which was down by 22% following a steady decline quarter after quarter. Its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription were doing better, though the overall growth was only up by 1%, and even that was driven by the "better-than-expected performance" of third-party games. You can give credit to titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 for why Xbox isn't in an even deeper hole than it is now.
 
The tech giant has no expectation that its Xbox brand will start making more money anytime soon. In its earnings call with investors, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the company expects Xbox will continue to decline "in the low to mid-single digits" for the following quarter. That's mostly due to the lack of landmark first-party titles. Just this month, Xbox released Ninja Gaiden 4, The Outer Worlds 2, and Double Fine's The Keeper. Xbox also made a huge marketing push for its first handheld, made in partnership with Asus, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X. In any other year, this would be a big month for any gaming company. The dour outlook comes after months of bad news. After two subsequent price hikes, Xbox Series S and Series X consoles now cost between $100 to $150 more than they did at launch five years ago. Microsoft also pushed prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription tier from $20 to $30 per month. A full-year's subscription would now demand $360. In a separate article, Gizmodo reviews Microsoft's new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which "offers a better experience overall" than the "other small-scale Windows PC gaming devices released this year." However, "it's still nowhere close to what you truly want from a console."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UN says boat strikes violate international law; Trump denies reports of escalation in Venezuela, and more</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/theeconomistmorningbriefing/episodes/un-says-boat-strikes-violate-international-law-trump-denies</link><author></author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/theeconomistmorningbriefing/e/69054bbec89076b5e2ce95ee/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3NjE5NTQ3MjE4MjgtN2M0MDM0YzctOTk0NC00ZmY2LWFkZmUtZGE0ZTg3MTlkN2QwLXB1YmxpY0ludHJvLm1wMyIsIm91dCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9hc3NldHMucGlwcGEuaW8vc2hvd3MvNjJlMjg2YTkzNGQ0ZDkwNmUzODc0MjRiLzE3NjE5NTQ3MjQyNjQtYWU0NDcxYmYtYmNhNS00M2JhLThlODctMjRhNGNjNmZkZmEzLXB1YmxpY091dHJvLm1wMyIsInN0YXR1cyI6InB1YmxpYyJ9&amp;sig=6UvL4whAWCce32Zp-3OwzgvGlZEOAQzcBOOImFtrs6Y" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 03:29:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.economist.com/audio/podcasts/the-world-in-brief">News - Daily Brief</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Java Virtual Threads VS GO routines</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/1oldyoo/java_virtual_threads_vs_go_routines/</link><author>/u/gamecrow77</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 03:25:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently had a argument with my tech lead about this , my push was for Go since its a new stack , new learning for the team and Go is evolving , my assumption is that we will find newer gen of devs who specialise in Go.

Profitability was seen as unambitious or even wrong – something to worry about when you hit scale. Why focus on profits when money and valuations were easy to come by?But that thinking was always flawed.Profitability isn't unambitious; it's controlling your own destiny. It means you don't have to rely on investors for survival. It means you can focus on your unaltered vision and mission. And it means you as a founder decide the pace of growth. And once you experience it, it's hard to imagine doing things any other way.Paul Graham famously wrote about "ramen profitability" – the point where a founding team could survive without external funding. He argued this made startups more attractive to investors, showing they could get customers to pay, were serious about building valuable products, and were disciplined with expenses.Graham wrote his essay in 2009. I’d argue that we now live in a world where it’s not just easier to get ramen profitable, but traditionally profitable – while also growing fast.At Linear we didn't set out to be profitable but kind of stumbled into it. We believed that to win this market we really needed to build a superior tool. The best way we knew how to do that was to keep the team small and focused. And when we launched after a year in private beta, almost all of our 100 beta users converted to paid customers. To our surprise, we realized it wouldn't take that long to become profitable if we kept the costs in check. Twelve months after launch, we hit profitability, and we've stayed profitable ever since.I don't know why hiring massive teams ever became the norm. In my own experience, small teams always delivered better quality, and faster. Maybe it's fear of missing out if you don't grow the team fast. Maybe it's investors whispering that your team is "understaffed compared to benchmarks." Being understaffed compared to benchmarks almost always should be a source of pride, not a problem. People should be surprised how small your team is, not how big it is.What holds you back is rarely team size – it's the clarity of your focus, skill and ability to execute. Larger teams mean slower progress, more management overhead, more meetings, more opinions, and usually dilution of vision and standards. Yet growing the team has somehow become a symbol of success.At Linear, we hired our first employee after six months and roughly doubled the team each year. With each hire, we make sure they truly elevate the team. We don't set out to hire ten engineers – we hire the next  engineer. This intentional approach has allowed us to maintain both quality and culture.The most underrated thing about profitability is how much peace of mind it gives you. Once you're profitable, you stop worrying about survival and focus on what really matters: building something great. Building the way you want. Instead of optimizing for the next fundraising round, you optimize for value creation.While profitability might not come quickly for every startup, I believe it's achievable sooner than most think. If you're creating a new market, or truly require massive scale like a social network, or significant upfront investment like a hardware company, it might take longer. But if you're in a category where there isn't hard upfront investment, and you get some level of product-market fit with customers willing to pay, you can probably be profitable. You can decide to become profitable. And usually, it's a decision about how much and how fast you hire.Revenue per employee is one of the clearest ways to see you’re hiring appropriately. While some of the best public companies benchmark at $1-2M per employee, for startups it's not unreasonable to target the range of $500k-$1M per employee.Understand Your Risk ProfileAre you building something highly speculative where you're not sure if there's a market for it, or are you building something that already has a market but with a different take on it? In the former case profitability takes longer, but in the latter it could happen right away. Most software today, especially in the B2B space, is about building a modern version of something existing.Hire Intentionally and SlowerFor most software startups, ten people before product-market fit should be your ceiling, not your target. After PMF, every hire should address a specific, pressing need – not just fill out an org chart. At Linear, our deliberately slow headcount growth forced us to be selective, which meant making better hires. It also protected our culture, since rapid hiring often dilutes the very things that made your startup special in the first place. When you hire less, you naturally hire better.Being profitable doesn't mean you have to be anti-investors. It means you have that choice, and investors are quite interested in profitable companies that also grow fast. You can raise more, less, or nothing. You can wait for the right timing, the right partner, or fund. For most ambitious startups, it can still be a good idea to raise something even if you could get by bootstrapping. Investors can still be helpful, and the additional cash balance can help you to make larger investments, or acquisitions.The point is that you can be and are allowed to be profitable as a startup. It's not a bad thing, it's not an oxymoron or as hard as people make it out to be. The secret is that a lot of successful companies actually were quite profitable early on, they just didn't talk about it. When you're profitable, you make decisions based on what's best for your customers and your product, not what's best for impressing investors.I didn't set out to build a profitable startup. But once I got there, I realized I wouldn't want to build a company any other way.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI Launches Aardvark To Detect and Patch Hidden Bugs In Code</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2314223/openai-launches-aardvark-to-detect-and-patch-hidden-bugs-in-code?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 02:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenAI has introduced Aardvark, a GPT-5-powered autonomous agent that scans, reasons about, and patches code like a human security researcher. "By embedding itself directly into the development pipeline, Aardvark aims to turn security from a post-development concern into a continuous safeguard that evolves with the software itself," reports InfoWorld. From the report: What makes Aardvark unique, OpenAI noted, is its combination of reasoning, automation, and verification. Rather than simply highlighting potential vulnerabilities, the agent promises multi-stage analysis -- starting by mapping an entire repository and building a contextual threat model around it. From there, it continuously monitors new commits, checking whether each change introduces risk or violates existing security patterns.
 
Additionally, upon identifying a potential issue, Aardvark attempts to validate the exploitability of the finding in a sandboxed environment before flagging it. This validation step could prove transformative. Traditional static analysis tools often overwhelm developers with false alarms -- issues that may look risky but aren't truly exploitable. "The biggest advantage is that it will reduce false positives significantly," noted Jain. "It's helpful in open source codes and as part of the development pipeline."
 
Once a vulnerability is confirmed, Aardvark integrates with Codex to propose a patch, then re-analyzes the fix to ensure it doesn't introduce new problems. OpenAI claims that in benchmark tests, the system identified 92 percent of known and synthetically introduced vulnerabilities across test repositories, a promising indication that AI may soon shoulder part of the burden of modern code auditing.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Europe is allowing itself to be dominated by the US. It just isn’t admitting as much</title><link>https://theconversation.com/europe-is-allowing-itself-to-be-dominated-by-the-us-it-just-isnt-admitting-as-much-267060</link><author>/u/Crossstoney</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 01:51:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[For 80 years, Europe maintained an asymmetric yet cooperative relationship with the United States. This imbalance, long accepted as the price of stability and protection, has shifted dramatically under US President Donald Trump. What was once a strategically uneven interdependence has become an unbreakable grip, which is used to exert pressure while being denied by its victims.In my book, l’Atlantisme est mort ? Vive l’Europe ! (Is Atlanticism Dead? Long Live Europe!), I describe this shift by introducing the concept of : a permitted grip in which Europeans, believing themselves to be partners, become dependent on a power that dominates them without their full awareness. does not merely refer to influence or soft power, but an internalised strategic subordination. Europeans justify this dependence in the name of realism, security, or economic stability, without recognising that it structurally weakens them.In Trump’s worldview, Europeans are no longer allies but freeloaders. The common market enabled them to become the world’s largest consumer zone and strengthen their companies’ competitiveness, including in the US market. Meanwhile, through NATO, they let Washington bear the costs of collective defence.The result? According to Trump, the US – because it is strong, generous, and noble – is being “taken advantage of” by its allies. This narrative justifies a shift: allies become resources to exploit. It is no longer cooperation, but extraction.Ukraine as a pressure leverThe war in Ukraine perfectly illustrates this logic. While the EU mobilized to support Kyiv, this solidarity became a vulnerability exploited by Washington. When the Trump administration temporarily suspended Ukrainian access to US intelligence, the Ukrainian army became blind. Europeans, also dependent on this data, were left half-blind.The administration’s move was not a mere tactical adjustment, but a strategic signal: European autonomy is conditional.In July 2025, the EU accepted a deeply unbalanced trade agreement imposing 15% tariffs on its products, without reciprocity. The Turnberry agreement was negotiated at Trump’s private estate in Scotland – a strong symbol of the personalization and brutalization of international relations.At the same time, the US stopped delivering weapons directly to Ukraine. Europeans now buy American-made arms and deliver them themselves to Kyiv. This is no longer partnership, but forced delegation.From partners to tributariesIn the logic of the MAGA movement, which is dominant within the Republican Party, Europe is no longer a partner. At best, it is a client; at worst, a tributary.In this situation, Europeans accept their subordination without naming it. This consent rests on two illusions: the idea that this dependence is the least bad option, and the belief that it is temporary.Yet many European actors – political leaders, entrepreneurs, and industrialists – supported the Turnberry agreement and the intensification of US arms purchases. In 2025, Europe accepted a perverse deal: paying for its political, commercial and budgetary alignment in exchange for uncertain protection.It is a quasi-mafia logic of international relations, based on intimidation, brutalization and the subordination of “partners”. Like Don Corleone in Frances Ford Coppola’s The Godfather, Trump seeks to impose an unpredictable American protection in exchange for an arbitrary price set unilaterally by the US. and imperialism: two logics of dominationIt is essential to distinguish  from other forms of domination. Unlike President Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whose imperialism relies on military violence, Trump’s US does not use direct force. When Trump threatens to annex Greenland, he exerts pressure but does not mobilize troops. He acts through economic coercion, trade blackmail, and political pressure.Because Europeans are partially aware of this and debate the acceptable degree of pressure, this grip is all the more insidious. It is systemic, normalized, and thus hard to contest.Putin’s regime, by contrast, relies on violence as a principle of government – against its own society and its neighbours. The invasion of Ukraine is its culmination. Both systems exercise domination, but through different logics: Russian imperialism is brutal and direct; US  is accepted, constraining, and denied.What makes  particularly dangerous is the denial that accompanies it. Europeans continue to speak of the transatlantic partnership, shared values, and strategic alignment. But the reality is one of accepted coercion.This denial is not only rhetorical: it shapes policies. European leaders justify trade concessions, arms purchases, and diplomatic alignments as reasonable compromises. They hope Trump will pass, that the old balance will return.But  is not a minor development. It is a structural transformation of the transatlantic relationship. And as long as Europe does not name it, it will keep weakening – strategically, economically and politically.Naming  to resist itEurope must open its eyes. The transatlantic link, once protective, has become an instrument of domination. The concept of  allows us to name this reality – and naming is already resisting.The question is now clear: does Europe want to remain a passive subject of US strategy, or become a strategic actor again?

FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said the ruling "exceeded the agency's authority and did not present an effective or agile response to the relevant cybersecurity threats." Carr said the vote scheduled for November 20 comes after "extensive FCC engagement with carriers" who have taken "substantial steps... to strengthen their cybersecurity defenses." Ars Technica reports: The FCC's January 2025 declaratory ruling came in response to attacks by China, including the Salt Typhoon infiltration of major telecom providers such as Verizon and AT&T. The Biden-era FCC found that the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), a 1994 law, "affirmatively requires telecommunications carriers to secure their networks from unlawful access or interception of communications."
 
"The Commission has previously found that section 105 of CALEA creates an affirmative obligation for a telecommunications carrier to avoid the risk that suppliers of untrusted equipment will "illegally activate interceptions or other forms of surveillance within the carrier's switching premises without its knowledge,'" the January order said. "With this Declaratory Ruling, we clarify that telecommunications carriers' duties under section 105 of CALEA extend not only to the equipment they choose to use in their networks, but also to how they manage their networks." A draft of the order that will be voted on in November can be found here (PDF).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>France mints Notre-Dame coin to celebrate reopening | REUTERS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8opvUn-Onxk</link><author>Reuters</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/8opvUn-Onxk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 01:17:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChqUTb7kYRX8-EiaN3XFrSQ">News - Reuters </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[France is minting 2 euro commemorative coins showing the Notre-Dame de Paris in celebration of the anniversary of the cathedral's reopening following the devastating fire of 2019.

Sign up forKlaxon, a newsletter that delivers our stories and tools directly to your inbox.\
One year after a Markup investigation revealed racial bias in Los Angeles’s housing intake system for people experiencing homelessness, local politicians have pressed for reforms and the agency responsible for housing is taking steps to make its approach more equitable and effective.\
Shortly after our original investigation published, Los Angeles City Council Member Nithya Raman, who chairs the Housing and Homelessness committee, introduced a motion citing the article and calling on the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) to come up with a plan to reform its intake system. The legislation, approved unanimously, called specifically for greater fairness in the “vulnerability” scoring system that The Markup analyzed. Used by Los Angeles for the past decade, the system rated Black people as significantly less vulnerable than White people year after year, making them less likely to obtain subsidized permanent housing.\
Black people are hugely overrepresented among unhoused people in L.A., making up about 9 percent of Los Angeles County’s population but about 30 percent of the county’s people experiencing homelessness.\
“To see that the tool that we’re using to put people in line for housing was not actually housing unhoused Black Angelenos as quickly as we could was really surprising to me,” said Raman, who read the article in the Los Angeles Times, where it was co-published. Raman, who is currently running for re-election in District Four, in central LA, said the investigation “absolutely” spurred the council to act.\
LAHSA, given a deadline of April 2023 in the legislation, still has not provided a reform plan. A spokesperson for the agency didn’t directly respond to a request for comment about the plan.\
Raman said LAHSA has taken some steps in the past year to improve how it allocates housing. Among other changes, she said, the agency has started to prioritize some groups, including those already involved in housing programs and those who already have the documents required to move into a building, like an ID and social security number.\
Meanwhile, the agency also de-emphasized the score’s importance in placing people for permanent housing. People applying for housing are scored on a 17-point scale. Previously, the people with the highest scores were given the highest priority, but now any person who scores an eight or above can be prioritized, depending on the other factors being considered.\
Still, equity in the housing system remains a known problem. In November, researchers from the University of Southern California and the University of California Los Angeles, working in partnership with LAHSA, released a long-awaited study on racial bias in the system and ways to reform the scoring system, known as the VI-SPDAT.\
The study, which analyzed scores across race and ethnicity, tracked with The Markup’s findings from earlier in the year, concluding that the scoring tool is biased toward White people and that it’s ineffective overall. The study, in some respects, went even further. Using data on who ultimately faced an “adverse” event, like jail or death, the researchers concluded that tool was “not much more accurate than a random guess at predicting vulnerability.”\
The study suggested several ways the scoring system could become more accurate and equitable, some of which matched The Markup’s reporting. The scoring system asks intensely personal questions about a person’s life, including around issues like violence and substance abuse, and the report recommends rewording and reframing questions to make the survey less complex and more sensitive. A revised version of the system with new questions and scoring could substantially reduce bias, the researchers conclude.\
For example, the study suggests that the existing question about whether anyone has “forced you or tricked you to do things that you do not want to do” should be amended to stress that answering yes “will not result in punishment or any negative consequences.” Another question currently asks, “Are there any medications like painkillers that you don’t take the way the doctor prescribed or where you sell the medication?” The study suggested softening it to, “Do you have medication that you choose to sell instead of taking to help support yourself financially? Answering yes to this question will not result in punishment or negative consequences for you.” Several questions were suggested for removal entirely.\
In a written statement, LAHSA spokesperson Christopher Yee acknowledged that it’s long been clear that “the VI-SPDAT has shortcomings related to equity,” adding that the survey is “long, cumbersome, and not trauma-informed in the content of the questions or administration process.”\
Yee highlighted the study on recommended changes to the system and said the agency is “working with key partners and stakeholders to create a plan to implement and refine” a new iteration of the scoring system while it continues to use the old version.\
The agency, he noted, has already dropped a requirement to score people for interim housing entry or time-limited subsidy programs, but will still require scoring for permanent housing. LAHSA must use some sort of prioritization system to access certain federal housing funds under rules established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban development.\
The planned changes to the scoring system will first apply to screening for adults, and later the agency plans to explore changes to related tools for young people and families with children. The Markup found that racial disparities were even more stark for a variation of the VI-SPDAT used in Los Angeles for people under the age of 25.\
Yee’s statement did not provide a timeline for the revised tool’s launch, but in a FAQ released alongside the study LAHSA said service providers could expect more information early this year on changes to the intake process, known as the Coordinated Entry System.\
Raman, for her part, said she’s withholding judgment until data can show how those changes affect who is housed. But, she said, “there’s no question in my mind that CES needs reform.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Up to 42 million US citizens depend on food aid, US courts order the govt to keep it open | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZ8KFFFYSO4</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lZ8KFFFYSO4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 00:14:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Federal judges have ordered the US administration to continue funding SNAP, the country's largest food aid program.

The Ministry achieved this status by migrating 1,200 employees to a Nextcloud-based cloud and collaboration platform hosted on Austrian-based infrastructure. This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers.
 
European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European." What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."
 
Austria's move and motivation echo similar efforts in Germany, Denmark, and other EU states and agencies. The organizations include the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, which abandoned Exchange and Outlook for open-source programs. Other agencies that have taken the same path away from Microsoft include the Austrian military, Danish government organizations, and the French city of Lyon. All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Steinberg, creators of VST technology and the ASIO protocol, have released the SDKs for VST 3 and ASIO as Open Source.</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1ola786/steinberg_creators_of_vst_technology_and_the_asio/</link><author>/u/fenix0000000</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Sat, 1 Nov 2025 00:05:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[   submitted by    /u/fenix0000000 ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Blackout hits Moscow Oblast during Ukrainian drone attack</title><link>https://english.nv.ua/russian-war/blackout-hits-moscow-oblast-during-drone-attack-50557188.html</link><author>/u/jackytheblade</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:50:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>YouTube TV Loses ESPN, ABC and Other Disney Channels</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/10/31/2017209/youtube-tv-loses-espn-abc-and-other-disney-channels?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Disney's channels, including ESPN, ABC, FX, and NatGeo, have gone dark on YouTube TV after Google and Disney failed to renew their carriage agreement before the October 30 deadline, with each side blaming the other for using unfair negotiating tactics and price hikes.

YouTube added that Disney's decision harms its subscribers while benefiting its own live TV products, such as Hulu+Live TV and Fubo.

Strange attractors - fancy math that creates beautiful patterns. At first I thought I'd just render one and move on, but then soon I realized that this is too much fun. When complexity emerges from three simple equations, when you see something chaotic emerge into beautiful, it's hard not to waste some time. I've spent countless hours, maybe more than I'd care to admit, watching these patterns form. I realized there's something deeply satisfying about seeing order emerge from randomness. Let me show you what kept me hooked.The Basics: Dynamical Systems and Chaos TheoryDynamical Systems are a mathematical way to understand how things . Imagine you have a system, which
could be anything from the movement of planets to the growth of a population. In this system, there are rules that
determine how it evolves from one moment to the next. These rules tell you what will happen next based on what is
happening now. Some examples are, a pendulum, the weather patterns, a flock of birds, the spread of a virus in a
population (we are all too familiar with this one), and stock market.There are two primary things to understand about this system:: This is like a big collection of all the possible states the system can be in. Each state is like a
snapshot of the system at a specific time. This is also called the  or the .: These are the rules that takes one state of the system and moves it to the next state. It can be
represented as a function that transforms the system from now to later.For instance, when studying population growth, a phase-space (world-state) might consist of the current population size
and the rate of growth or decline at a specific time. The dynamics would then be derived from models of population
dynamics, which, considering factors like birth rates, death rates, and carrying capacity of the environment, dictate
the changes in population size over time.Another way of saying this is that the dynamical systems describe how things change over time, in a space of
possibilities, governed by a set of rules. Numerous fields such as biology, physics, economics, and applied mathematics,
study systems like these, focusing on the specific rules that dictate their evolution. These rules are grounded in
relevant theories, such as Newtonian mechanics, fluid dynamics, and mathematics of economics, among others.There are different ways of classifying dynamical systems, and one of the most interesting is the classification into
chaotic and non-chaotic systems. The change over time in non-chaotic systems is more deterministic as compared to
chaotic systems which exhibit randomness and unpredictability. is the sub branch of dynamical systems that studies chaotic systems and challenges the traditional
deterministic views of causality. Most of the natural systems we observe are chaotic in nature, like the weather, a drop
of ink dissolving in water, social and economic behaviours etc. In contrast, systems like the movement of planets,
pendulums, and simple harmonic oscillators are extremely predictable and non-chaotic.Chaos Theory deals with systems that exhibit irregular and unpredictable behavior over time, even though they follow
deterministic rules. Having a set of rules that govern the system, and yet exhibit randomness and unpredictability,
might seem a bit contradictory, but it is because the rules do not always represent the whole system. In fact, most of
the time, these rules are an approximation of the system and that is what leads to the unpredictability. In complex
systems, we do not have enough information to come up with a perfect set of rules. And by using incomplete information
to make predictions, we introduce uncertainty, which amplifies over time, leading to the chaotic behaviour.Chaotic systems generally have many non-linear interacting components, which we partially understand (or can partially
observe) and which are very sensitive to small changes. A small change in the initial conditions can lead to a
completely different outcome, a phenomenon known as the . In this post, we will try to see the
butterfly effect in action but before that, let's talk about .To understand Strange Attractors, let's first understand what an attractor is. As discussed earlier, dynamical systems
are all about . During this change, the system moves through different possible states (remember the
phase space jargon?). An attractor is a set of states towards which a system tends to settle over time, or you can say,
towards which it is . It's like a magnet that pulls the system towards it.For example, think of a pendulum. When you release it, it swings back and forth, but eventually, it comes to rest at the
bottom. The bottom is the attractor in this case. It's the state towards which the pendulum is attracted.This happens due to the system's inherent dynamics, which govern how states in the phase space change. Here are some of
the reasons why different states get attracted towards attractors:: Attractors are stable states of the system, meaning that once the system reaches them, it tends to stay
there. This stability arises from the system's dynamics, which push it towards the attractor and keep it there.: Many dynamical systems have dissipative forces, which cause the system to lose energy over time. This
loss of energy leads the system to settle into a lower-energy state, which often corresponds to an attractor. This is
what happens in the case of the pendulum.: In some regions of the phase space, the system's dynamics cause trajectories to converge. This
contraction effect means that nearby states will tend to come closer together over time, eventually being drawn
towards the attractor.Some attractors have complex governing equations that can create unpredictable trajectories or behaviours. These
nonlinear interactions can result in multiple stable states or periodic orbits, towards which the system evolves. These
complex attractors are categorised as . They are called "strange" due to their unique
characteristics.: Strange attractors often have a fractal-like structure, meaning they display intricate
patterns that repeat at different scales. This complexity sets them apart from simpler, regular attractors.Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions: Systems with strange attractors are highly sensitive to their initial
conditions. Small changes in the starting point can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known
as the "butterfly effect".Unpredictable Trajectories: The trajectories on a strange attractor never repeat themselves, exhibiting
non-periodic motion. The system's behavior appears random and unpredictable, even though it is governed by
deterministic rules.Emergent Order from Chaos: Despite their chaotic nature, strange attractors exhibit a form of underlying order.
Patterns and structures emerge from the seemingly random behavior, revealing the complex dynamics at play.You can observe most of these characteristics in the visualisation. The one which is most fascinating to observe is the
butterfly effect.A butterfly can flutter its wings over a flower in China and cause a hurricane in the Caribbean.One of the defining features of strange attractors is their sensitivity to initial conditions. This means that small
changes in the starting state of the system can lead to vastly different long-term behaviors, a phenomenon known as the
. In chaotic systems, tiny variations in the initial conditions can amplify over time, leading to
drastically different outcomes.In our visualisation, let's observe this behavior on Thomas Attractor. It is governed by the following equations:A small change in the parameter  can lead to vastly different particle trajectories and the overall shape of the
attractor. Change this value in the control panel and observe the butterfly effect in action.There is another way of observing the butterfly effect in this visualisation. Change the  from  to
 in the control panel and observe how the particles move differently in the two cases. The particles
eventually get attracted to the same states but have different trajectories.This visualization required rendering a large number of particles using Three.js. To achieve this efficiently, we used a
technique called . This method handles iterative updates of particle systems directly on the GPU,
minimizing data transfers between the CPU and GPU. It utilizes two frame buffer objects (FBOs) that alternate roles: One
stores the current state of particles and render them on the screen, while the other calculates the next state.Setting Up Frame Buffer Objects (FBOs): We start by creating two FBOs,  and , to hold the current and
next state of particles. These buffers store data such as particle positions in RGBA channels, making efficient use
of GPU resources.Shader Programs for Particle Dynamics: The shader programs execute on the GPU and apply attractor dynamics to
each particle. Following is the attractor function which update the particle positions based on the attractor equation.Rendering and Buffer Swapping: In each frame, the shader computes the new positions based on the attractor's
equations and stores them in the inactive buffer. After updating, the roles of the FBOs are swapped: The previously
inactive buffer becomes active, and vice versa.This combination of efficient shader calculations and the ping-pong technique allows us to render the particle system.If you have any comments, please leave them on this GitHub discussions topic. Sooner or later, I will integrate it with the blog.

Observers regard it as one of the more anticipated community-driven launches of the year, comparable to projects such as Aster and Four.meme.Raising over $2 million within days of opening, BALZ has positioned itself as a significant project developing on BNB, despite its informal branding and memetic culture. With more than 40,000 members prior to its anticipated token presale, the project has adopted an unconventional approach to community growth through guerrilla marketing and its "rug pull recovery protocol."Instead of allocating capital to influencer campaigns, the team integrated communities from Solana and Base, migrating them to BNB through its protocol. At the time of writing, more than 10,000 verified holders are in the process of migration.The Token Presale: Closing Tonight, October 31st at 23:59 PDTAt the center of BALZ is the Fair-As-F* Launch (FAF), a limited-time token presale closing on October 31 at 23:59 PDT. Within days of opening, BALZ raised over $2 million, drawing parallels to earlier community-led launches such as Shiba Inu and Floki in 2020.FAF is structured with a fixed price and specific time frame, allowing equal participation without insider advantages or automated trading. In a market that has frequently favored early access and automation, BALZ seeks to show that fairness can be built into its design.BNB Market Conditions and TimingThe timing aligns with a significant shift in the cryptocurrency market. On October 10, 2025, the sector experienced its largest liquidation event to date, with $19 billion eliminated within 48 hours as Bitcoin declined from $126,000 to $105,000. This event represented market deleveraging rather than capitulation.Open interest decreased from $48.7 billion to $45.1 billionFunding rates fell by 51 percentOverleveraged positions were clearedThe result is a market now characterized by conviction-based participants and institutional capital seeking new deployment opportunities.Market structure mirrors 2020-2021 exactly:Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $2.71 billion during October 6-10, BlackRock's IBIT holding $65.26 billion85% of institutional firms now allocate to digital assetsFed rate cuts hit 93% probability for next quarterBNB Smart Chain Shows Continued Growth3.62 million daily active addresses in October 2025Total Value Locked surged 217% to $17.1 billion70% of BNB meme traders are currently profitableCZ is back.

The company will, however, continue to allow legitimate sideloading for developers. Heise reports: In response to an inquiry, Amazon explained that it has always worked to ban piracy from its app store. As part of an expanded program led by the ACE, it is now blocking apps that demonstrably provide access to pirated content, including those downloaded outside the app store. This builds on Amazon's ongoing efforts to support creators and protect customers, as piracy can also expose users to malware, viruses, and fraud.
 
[...] The sideloading option will remain available on Fire TV devices running Amazon's new operating system, Vega OS. However, it is generally limited to developers here.

The aircraft reportedly had no active transponder and no filed flight plan, according to Poland’s Operational Command.While Polish officials stressed that the Russian plane did not enter their sovereign airspace, the encounter added to a growing list of similar provocations. “We thank the Air Force for their professionalism, vigilance, and exemplary execution of the mission,” the Polish Armed Forces said in a statement on X (formerly Twitter). “Poland remains in full combat readiness and responds effectively to all provocative actions by the Russian Federation.”Over the past two months, Lithuania and Estonia have each reported unauthorized Russian planes entering their airspace — claims Moscow has denied. Russia maintains that all its flights are routine training missions and insists no borders have been violated.Still, the repeated incursions have led some NATO members to consider invoking Article Four, which calls for formal discussions when any member feels its territorial integrity or security is under threat.According to NATO, Russian aircraft traveling to and from the Kaliningrad region frequently fly close to alliance airspace without active transponders. In this latest incident, the Polish jets followed standard NATO procedures to escort the Russian plane safely out of the area.Newsweek has reached out to NATO and the U.S. State Department for comment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Borrow checker says “No”!

It feels as though it is the single most time consuming issue to fix and always seems to catch me unaware. The issue in particular is “cannot borrow x immutably as it is already borrowed mutably” - it manifests itself in different ways under different circumstances, but I find myself hitting it often when refactoring. It happened again recently so I did some investigating and thought I would discuss it in more detail.The issue last hit me when I was refactoring some code in my graphics engine hotline, I have been creating some content on YouTube and, after a little bit of a slog to fix the issue, I recorded a video of me going through the scenario of how it occurred and some patterns to use that I have adopted in the past to get around it. You can check out the video if you are that way inclined, the rest of this post will mostly echo what is in the video, but it might be a bit easier to follow code snippets and description in text.I have a generic graphics API, which consists of traits called gfx. This is there to allow different platform backends to implement the trait; currently I have a fully implemented Direct3D12 backend and I recently began to port macOS using Metal.The gfx backend wraps underlying graphics API primitives; in this case we are mostly concerned about  which is a command buffer. Command buffers are used to submit commands to the GPU. They do things like  or , amongst other things. For the purposes of this blog post, what the command buffer does is not really that important, just that is does , which at the starting point when the code was working is a trait method that takes an immutable self and another immutable parameter ie. fn do_something(&self, param: &Param).In the rest of the code base I have a higher level rendering system called . This is graphics engine code that is not platform specific but implements shared functionality. So where  is a low level abstraction layer,  implements concepts of a  that is a view of a scene that we can render from. A  has a camera that can look at the scene and is then passed to a render function, which can build a command buffer to render the scene from that camera’s perspective. The engine is designed to be multithreaded and render functions are dispatched through  systems, so a view gets passed into a render system but it is wrapped in an .I made a small cutdown example of this code to be able to demonstrate the problem I encounter, so let’s start with the initial working version:I tried to simplify it as much as possible so these snippets should compile if you copy and paste them, they won’t run thanks to  macro (which I absolutely love using, it is so handy!) but we only care about the borrow checker anyway.All we really need to think about is that a  can  and it also gets passed in a , which is also contained as part of ‘view’. Coming from a C/C++ background I landed on my personal preference being procedural C code with context passing, so I tend to group things together into a single struct. It makes sense to me in this case and I wanted to group everything inside , and we fetch the view from elsewhere in the engine.So the code in the snippet compiles fine and I was working with this setup for some time. I began work on macOS and it turned out that the  method needed to mutate the command buffer so that I could mutate some internal state and make the Metal graphics API behave similarly to Direct3D12. This is common for graphics API plumbing.The specific example in this case was that in Direct3D we call a function  to bind an index buffer before we make a call to , but in Metal there is no equivalent to bind an index buffer. Instead you pass a pointer to your index buffer when calling the equivalent draw indexed. So to fix this, when we call  we can store some extra state in the command buffer so we can pass it in the later call to .In hindsight any method on the command buffer trait that does anything, like set anything or write into the command buffer, should take a  because it is mutating the command buffer after all. In my case since I am calling through to methods on  , which is unsafe code and does not require any mutable references.In our simplified example, in order to store, state  now needs to change and take a mutable self: do_something(&mut self, param: &Param) it should be noted that  itself was already .Borrow checker now kicks in…my heart sinks. In the real code base not only did I have to modify a single call site, but I had hundreds of places where this error was happening, I made the decision here and now to make any methods that write to the command buffer also be mutable and make the mutabilityerror[E0502]: cannot borrow `view` as immutable because it is also borrowed as mutable

error: could not compile due to 1 previous error
This is not the first time I have encountered this problem and I doubt it will be the last. There are a number of ways to resolve it and they aren’t too complicated. The frustrating thing is that it seems to occur always when you are doing something else and not just when you decide to refactor, so you end up having a mountain of errors to solve before you can get back to the original task. I suppose you could call it a symptom of bad design or lack of experience, but when writing code things inevitably change and bend with new requirements, and Rust throws these unexpected issues up for me more often than I find with C, and often the required refactor takes more effort as well. But that is the cost you pay, hopefully more upfront effort to get past the borrow checker means fewer nasty debugging stages later. So let’s look at some patterns to fix the issue!The one I actually went for in this case was using . We take the  out of view so we no longer need to borrow a ‘view’ to use , and then when finished return the cmd into ‘view’. It is important to note here that  needs to derive default in order for this to work, as when we take the  in  will become This approach is the simplest I could think of at the time because any existing code using  doesn’t need updating, everything stays the same and we just separate the references. In this case it was easy to derive the default for  .You need to remember to set the  back on  here, which could be a pitfall and cause unexpected behaviour if you didn’t.If you can’t easily derive default on a struct there are some other options. If the struct is clonable or you can easily derive a clone, you can clone to achieve a similar effect.Cloning might be considered a heavier operation than ‘take’ depending on the circumstances, but this method has the same benefit as the take version whereby unaffected code that is using  elsewhere doesn’t need to be changed.Another approach would be to use  this allows for interior mutability and again we do not need to worry about default or clone.We also need to update any code that ever used  and do the same. Not ideal but it allows us to get around the need for a default or clone. I have had to resort to this in other places in the code base.There are more options; quite literally  here can help. If we make  an  then this gives us the ability to use  as the default and we can use the  approach. We can also use  and swap with . Swapping works similar to ‘take’, where we take mem and swap with the default.The  approach also requires more effort as we need to now take a reference and unwrap the option and update any code that ever used  to do the same. Not ideal, but it allows us to get around the need for a default or clone, and if your type is already optional then this will fit easily.There is one final approach that could save a lot of time, and that would be to not change the  function at all in the first place. That is to keep it as do_something(&self, param: &Param). So how do we mutate the interior state without requiring the self to be mutable?This can be done with  in single threaded code or  in multithreaded code. Since we already looked at  I will do an example of .I decided to make the mutability explicit to the trait and that was based on how the command buffers are used in the engine, in other places I have taken other approaches favouring interior mutability. For this case a view can be dispatched in parallel with other views, but the engine is designed such that 1 thread per view and no work happens to a single view on multiple threads at the same time. Command buffers are submitted in a queue in order and dispatched on the GPU.Here it made sense to me to avoid locking interior mutability for each time we call a method on a  and it works with the engine’s design. We lock a view at the start of a render thread, fill it with commands and then hand it back to the graphics engineer for submission to the GPU. The usage is explicit, we just needed to appease the borrow checker!I hope you enjoyed this article, please check out my YouTube channel for more videos or more articles on my blog, let me know what you think and if you have any other strategies or approaches I would love to hear about them.

Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash. Known as Chat Control, the measure was intended to crack down on the trafficking of child sex abuse materials (CSAM). After days of silence, the German government on October 8 announced it would not support the proposal, tanking the Danish effort.
 
Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told reporters on Thursday that his office will support voluntary CSAM detections. "This will mean that the search warrant will not be part of the EU presidency's new compromise proposal, and that it will continue to be voluntary for the tech giants to search for child sexual abuse material," Hummelgaard said, according to local news reports. The current model allowing for voluntary scanning expires in April, Hummelgaard said. "Right now we are in a situation where we risk completely losing a central tool in the fight against sexual abuse of children," he said. "That's why we have to act no matter what. We owe it to all the children who are subjected to monstrous abuse."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Three Key Races to Watch Ahead of Election Day 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmkMCb8Ry34</link><author>Bloomberg Television</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wmkMCb8Ry34?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 22:09:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIALMKvObZNtJ6AmdCLP7Lg">News - Bloomberg </source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Cook Political Report US House Editor Erin Covey previews the races to watch on Election Day including the NYC Mayoral race where Covey suggests Democratic nominee Zohran Mamdani is likely to win as polling shows he has a double digit lead over Independent candidate Andrew Cuomo.

Even in omicron#9259, the capacity=1 channel was basically behaving as documented and as one would expect.  It woke up a sender when capacity was available, and the other senders were blocked to maintain the documented FIFO property.  However, some of the patterns that we use with bounded channels are problematic on their own and, if changed, could prevent the channel from getting caught up in a futurelock.In Omicron, we commonly use bounded channels with .  The bound is intended to cap memory usage and provide backpressure, but using the blocking  creates a second  queue: the wait queue for the channel.  Instead, we could consider using a larger capacity channel plus  and propagate failure from .As an example, when we use the actor pattern, we typically observe that there’s only one actor and potentially many clients, so there’s not much point in buffering messages  the channel.  So we use  and let clients block in .  But we could instead have  and have clients use  and propagate failure if they’re unable to send the message.  The value  here is pretty arbitrary.  You want it to be large enough to account for an expected amount of client concurrency, but not larger.  If the value is too small, you’ll wind up with spurious failures when the client could have just waited a bit longer.  If the value is too large, you can wind up queueing so much work that the actor is always behind (and clients are potentially even timing out at a higher level).  One might observe:Channel limits, channel limits: always wrong!Some too short and some too long!But as with timeouts, it’s often possible to find values that work in practice.Using  is  a mitigation because this still results in the sender blocking.  It needs to be polled after the timeout expires in order to give up.  But with futurelock, it will never be polled.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bluesky hits 40 million users, introduces ‘dislikes’ beta</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/bluesky-hits-40-million-users-introduces-dislikes-beta/</link><author>Sarah Perez</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 20:14:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As users "dislike" posts, the system will learn what sort of content they want to see less of.

Once there, the applied holography quickly joined the quest into the properties of this phase that had long evaded a consistent and satisfactory explanation.\
Instead of going after the NFL fermion propagator, however, many of the holographic proposals focused on reproducing the experimental data in the cuprates - and often times even claimed achieving a quantitative agreement.\
In light of its intrinsically unsettled status one would have thought that it might be rather detrimental for any speculative approach to seek out not a mere qualitative but an actual quantitative, down to the number, agreement between its specific predictions and some preselected sets of experimental data. In fact, if such a quantitative agreement were indeed achieved one would have even more explaining to do (first and foremost, as to why an apriori approximate approach appears to be so unexpectedly accurate?).\
The earlier discussion of some of the popular evidence in support of condensed matter holography as well as the debunking of a number of its specific predictions [26] can be found in [34]. However, the admirable persistence with which those predictions continued to be regularly cited in the subsequent holographic literature [35] suggests that the comments of [34] might have had been (most regretfully) overlooked.\
In fact, there is more than a single reason for which semiclassical holography (or its improvement at the level of accounting for the matter back-reaction in the HartreeFock approximation) - thus far, the only practical way of performing the holographic calculations [26–29] - would not have been expected to provide any quantitatively accurate results in the first place. There are, of course, such obvious differences from the string-theoretical holographic constructions as a low physical value of N (which, in practice, often amounts to ’spin up/down’) and the lack of Lorentz, translational, and/or rotational (as well as any super-)symmetries.\
Arguably, though, the most important is the fact that much of the condensed matter physics operates in the intermediate - as opposed to ultra-strong - interaction regime, while it is only the latter that is supposed to have a weakly coupled gravity as its bulk dual [26]. Indeed, most solids form under the condition that its potential (interaction) and kinetic energies on average balance each other out. This suggests that the ’bona fide’ strong-coupling regime could only become attainable in some sort of a ’flat band’ scenario where kinetic energy is completely quenched or, at least, significantly diminished.\
In light of that, it is unsurprising that much of the recent effort towards implementing such mechanism has been centered on the SYK model and its variants [31] whose ’flat band’ nature facilitates the existence of a holographic dual. A viable candidate to this role was proposed in the form of the Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) dilatonenhanced 1 + 1-dimensional gravity [31].\
It is worth pointing out, though, that at the practical level all the holographic matching between the SYK and JT theories has been, so far, established within their low-energy sectors that are both controlled by a single soft Schwarzian mode (’boundary graviton’). So as far as the low-energy properties of the two models are concerned, they both allow for the same (effectively 0 + 1- dimensional) description in terms of either a fluctuating 1d boundary or Liouvillian-type large-N matrix quantum mechanics [31, 36]. This is not surprising given the intrinsically non-dynamical nature of 2d (and 3d) pure gravity. Such a caveat notwithstanding, the low-energy SYK-JT equivalence has been repeatedly and staunchly referred to as a genuine example of holographic correspondence between the 1+1-dimensional bulk and 0+1-dimensional boundary theories [31].\
As to the general HV models (22) and corresponding vacuum metrics (26), the standard list of observables to be matched includes temperature-dependent specific heat\
and frequency-dependent optical conductivity\
determined by the bare scaling dimensions.\
Incidentally, this value of the HV parameter was previously singled out on the basis of analyzing entanglement entropy [28]. Besides, it suggests the interpretation of d − θ as an effective number of dimensions orthogonal to the FS.\
The other frequently invoked relation [26, 28, 29] is\
in which case the first inequality in (27) is marginally satisfied as equality. Notably, in 2d it would only be consistent with (40) for z = 3/2.\
Also, from the beginning of the cuprates saga an even greater fixation has always been on the linear-T dependence of resistivity, also observed in a variety of other materials [35]. Of course, the conductivity scaling with frequency (39) does not readily translate into its temperature dependence, as it would be determined by a specific mechanism of momentum relaxation (i.e., Umklapp, phonons, and/or disorder).\
To this end, the use of the memory matrix technique yielded a proper conductivity scaling [26, 35] in both limits of strong,\
momentum-non-conserving scattering where ∆ is the dimension of the leading translation invariance-breaking 8 operator. The formulas (42) and (43) agree for ∆ = z + (d − θ)/2 which condition coincides with that of marginal fulfillment of the Harris criterion for the disorder scattering to become a relevant perturbation.\
An alternate interpretation of the linear-T resistivity, σ(T ) ∼ 1/T , proposed in [26, 35] relates it to the FL-like entropy, S(T ) ∼ C(T ) ∼ T . This school of thought introduces the notion of inelastic ’Planckian’ scattering rate as a potentially single most important scale for thermalization/equilibration/information scrambling (albeit not a rate of momentum relaxation) in strongly interacting systems\
Interestingly, it is the (admittedly, unphysical) model of [38] that so far has managed to reproduce a longer list of the power-law dependencies found in the cuprates, as compared to the competing schemes [39]. Unfortunately, such a serendipitous success does not offer any immediate insight into the underlying mechanism of the NFL behavior in the cuprates.\
Furthermore, contrasting the large-r and -τ asymptotics (31) of the HV holographic propagators against their eikonal/bosonization counterparts in search of some agreement suggests finite positive values of θ, contrary to the ’Planckian’ scenario. This observation might further reduce the chances of constructing a consistent HV holographic model of the strange metal phase in the cuprates.\
In part, the deficiencies of the HV-based approach have been circumvented by the arrival of the ’second SYK wave’ [40] which utilizes the Hamiltonian obtained from the conventional combination of a kinetic (quadratic) and interaction (quartic) terms by randomizing the amplitudes of either one or both of these terms a la SY K. Making such randomization spatially non-uniform one opens a channel for non-conservation of momentum which then gives rise to the linear-T ’Planckian’ rate (on top of a constant).\
Of course, the very existence of different explanations (cf., for example, [35, 39] and [40]) for certain scaling laws observed in the cuprates may suggest that their ultimate interpretation is yet to be found. It would be, therefore, imperative to strive to extend the list of matching properties, akin to [38, 39] as the means of discriminating between the competing schemes.(1) D. V.

Providing robust features for data discovery, such as browsing, filtering, and search, has traditionally required dedicated computing infrastructure such as servers and databases. Ongoing server hosting, regular security and software updates, and consistent operational oversight are expensive and require skilled staff. Over years or decades, budget changes and staff turnover often strand these projects in an unmaintained or nonfunctioning state.The alternative, static file hosting, requires minimal maintenance and reduces expenses dramatically. For example, storing gigabytes of data on Amazon S3 may cost $1/month or less. However, static hosting often diminishes the capacity for rich data discovery. Without a dynamic computing layer between the user’s web browser and the source files, data access may be restricted to brittle pre-rendered browsing hierarchies or search functionality that is impeded by client memory limits. Under such barriers, the collection’s discoverability suffers.For years, online collection discovery has been stuck between a rock and a hard place: accept the complexity and expense required for a good user experience, or opt for simplicity and leave users to contend with the blunt limitations of a static discovery layer.Why We Explored a New ApproachWhen LIL began thinking about how to provide discovery for the Data.gov Archive, we decided that building a lightweight and easily maintained access point from the beginning would be worth our team’s effort. We wanted to provide low-effort discovery with minimal impact on our resources. We also wanted to ensure that whatever path we chose would encourage, rather than impede, long-term access.This approach builds on our recent experience when the Caselaw Access Project (CAP) hit a transition moment. At that time, we elected to switch case.law to a static site and to partner with others dedicated to open legal data to provide more feature-rich access.CAP includes some 11 TB of data; the Data.gov Archive represents nearly 18 TB, with the catalog metadata alone accounting for about 1 GB. Manually browsing the archive data in its repository, even for a user who knows what she’s looking for, is laborious and time-consuming. Thus we faced a challenge. Could we enable dynamic, scalable discovery of the Data.gov Archive while enjoying the frugality, simplicity, and maintainability of static hosting?Our Experiment: Rich Discovery, No Server RequiredRecent advancements in client-side data analysis led us to try something new. Tools like DuckDB-Wasm, sql.js-httpvfs, and Protomaps, powered by standards such as WebAssembly, web workers, and HTTP range requests, allow users to efficiently query large remote datasets in the browser. Rather than downloading a 2 GB data file into memory, these tools can incrementally retrieve only the relevant parts of the file and process query results locally.We developed Data.gov Archive Search on the same model. Here’s how it works: We store Data.gov Archive catalog metadata as sorted, compressed Parquet files on Source.coop, taking advantage of performant static file hosting. Our client-side web application loads DuckDB-Wasm, a fully functional database engine running inside the user’s browser. When a user navigates to a resource or submits a search, our DuckDB-Wasm client executes a targeted retrieval of the data needed to fulfill the request. No dedicated server is required; queries run entirely in the browser.This experiment has not been without obstacles. Getting good performance out of this model demands careful data engineering, and the large DuckDB-Wasm binary imposes a considerable latency cost. As of this writing, we’re continuing to explore speedy alternatives like hyparquet and Arquero to further improve performance.Still, we’re pleased with the result: an inexpensive, low-maintenance static discovery platform that allows users to browse, search, and filter Data.gov Archive records entirely in the browser.Why This Matters for Libraries, Digital Humanities Projects, and BeyondThis new pattern offers a compelling model for libraries, academic archives, and DH projects of all sizes: By shifting from an expensive server to lower cost static storage, projects can sustainably offer their users access to data.Reduced technical overhead: With no dedicated backend server, security risks are reduced, no patching or upgrades are needed, and crashing servers are not a concern. Projects can be set up with care, but without demanding constant attention. Organizations can be more confident that their archive and discovery interfaces remain usable and accessible, even as staffing or funding changes over time.Knowing that we are not the only group interested in approaching access in this way, we’re sharing our generalized learnings. We see a few ways forward for others in the knowledge and information world: If your organization has large, relatively static datasets, consider experimenting with a browser-based search tool using static hosting. Template applications, workflows, and lessons learned can help this new pattern gain adoption and maturity across the community.This project is still evolving, and we invite others—particularly those in libraries and digital cultural heritage—to explore these possibilities with us. We’re committed to open sharing as we refine our tools, and we welcome collaboration or feedback at lil@law.harvard.edu.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/chatgpt-everything-to-know-about-the-ai-chatbot/</link><author>Kyle Wiggers, Cody Corrall, Alyssa Stringer, Kate Park</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:36:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A timeline of ChatGPT product updates and releases, starting with the latest, which we’ve been updating throughout the year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tattd gave four TechCrunch writers tattoos at Startup Battlefield</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/tattd-gave-four-techcrunch-writers-tattoos-at-startup-battlefield/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:32:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tattd, a marketplace for tattoo-seekers and artists, set up a mini tattoo parlor in the Expo Hall at TechCrunch Disrupt 2025.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hackers threaten to leak data after breaching University of Pennsylvania to send mass emails</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/hackers-threaten-to-leak-data-after-breaching-university-of-pennsylvania-to-send-mass-emails/</link><author>Amanda Silberling</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:30:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[As the hackers plainly stated in their message ("Please stop giving us money"), this breach appears motivated to suppress alumni donations. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump says he is not considering strikes within Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-is-not-considering-strikes-within-venezuela-2025-10-31/</link><author>/u/Crossstoney</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:22:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leader of Dutch far-right PVV suggests Tuesday election was rigged, but has no evidence</title><link>https://nltimes.nl/2025/10/31/leader-dutch-far-right-pvv-suggests-tuesday-election-rigged-evidence</link><author>/u/SubNL96</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:09:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Russia Appears To Warn U.S. Over Pressure Against Venezuela: &apos;We Stand Ready To Respond Appropriately&apos;</title><link>https://www.latintimes.com/russia-appears-warn-us-over-pressure-against-venezuela-we-stand-ready-respond-appropriately-591105</link><author>/u/Infidel8</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 17:07:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Russian government appeared to send a warning to the Trump administration over its pressure campaign against Venezuela, saying Moscow stands "ready to respond appropriately to the requests of our partners in light of emerging threats.""We support the leadership of Venezuela in defending its national sovereignty, taking into account the dynamics of the international & regional situation" said press official Maria Zakharova, according to a social media publication from the Russian Foreign Ministry.However, many indicators point at the Trump administration dismissing any concern and moving towards escalation. In fact, a new report detailed that the president has been presented with a list of potential strikes inside Venezuela.The Wall Street Journal detailed that the targets are considered nexus between the Nicolas Maduro regime and drug-trafficking organizations. They include military ports and airports, as well as naval facilities and airstrips.The outlet noted that Trump hasn't made a final decision yet, but he has publicly suggested the current military campaign would go from conducting strikes against alleged drug boats in the ocean to others in land.The focus of the escalation, it added, would be to convince Maduro to step down. "The President is prepared to use every element of American power to stop drugs from flooding into our homeland," White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told the WSJ in a statement.Several Republican officials have been supportive of the operation, with some claiming that the regime's days are numbered. However, a growing number of GOP lawmakers are publicly demanding greater oversight of the campaign. But the administration is so confident that its military campaign is so popular that it doesn't need approval from Congress, according to another report.Concretely, a White House official told Politico this week that the strikes against the vessels in the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific fulfill a campaign promise from Donald Trump to deal with drug cartels.© 2025 Latin Times.

Let’s dig in.Among the React crowd, and also among people who seem to enjoy HTMX, I see a lot this…
	Open Modal
This element does not announce itself as an interactive element to screen reader users.You can’t focus on a  with a keyboard.The event only fires on , not when the  or  keys are pressed (again, keyboard users).I’ve had arguments with a very prominent React thought leader whose name starts with R who insisted that using a  was “more accessible” than using a , and that Twitter made the right decision in using this pattern in their app.It’s wrong. It’s all wrong.Many HTML elements have  that tell assistive tech like screen readers what they do.The  element is one of them. It has an implicit  of , which tells screen reader users it can be interacted with and will trigger some type of behavior in the app.The HTML  attribute can be used to add or modify the role of an element. And so, folks like React Ry–thought-leader-guy will say stuff like (I’m paraphrasing)…That attribute exists for a reason. You can add  to a  to give it the correct semantics.OK, that addresses one issue.That role doesn’t affect focusability (or lack thereof) or keyboard behavior. Visually impaired users and people who navigate with a keyboard still can’t use it.“No worries!” they say. “We can fix that, too!”You can make the element focusable with the  attribute.
	Open Modal
You , though! Seriously, just don’t fuck with focus order.It’s way too easy to go down this path and then fuck it up and have folks jumping all over the page instead of navigating through in the normal and expected order.And again, still no keyboard interactivity.But don’t fear! You can add that, too. You just need to listen for all  events, and then filter them out by  so that you only run your code if the  or  keys were pressed (the latter means checking for a literal space: ).That can’t run on the element, either. You’ve got to attach that even to the  and figure out which element has focus.So um… ok, I guess it is technically a fix, but…You’ve just recreated all of the functionality a  gives you for freeSeriously, WTF would you do that?!?All of these hoops to write this HTML…
	Open Modal
When you could write this HTML instead…
	Open Modal
Has the correct  implicitly.Is automatically focusable.Fires a  event in response to  and  presses when it has focus.Look, I’m a lazy developer.And I suspect, if you’re someone who loves tools like React, you probably are, too. It’s cool, I get it! The best code is the code you didn’t write and all that.Use the correct element for the job, and avoid writing a bunch of extra code!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AWS exceeds Wall Street’s expectations as demand for cloud infra remains high</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/aws-exceeds-wall-streets-expectations-as-demand-for-cloud-infra-remains-high/</link><author>Rebecca Szkutak</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:59:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AWS continues to see strong demand as companies gobble up its cloud infrastructure services in the age of AI. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Futurelock: A subtle risk in async Rust</title><link>https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0609</link><author>bcantrill</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:49:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Bounded channels are not really the issue here.  Even in omicron#9259, the capacity=1 channel was basically behaving as documented and as one would expect.  It woke up a sender when capacity was available, and the other senders were blocked to maintain the documented FIFO property.  However, some of the patterns that we use with bounded channels are problematic on their own and, if changed, could prevent the channel from getting caught up in a futurelock.In Omicron, we commonly use bounded channels with .  The bound is intended to cap memory usage and provide backpressure, but using the blocking  creates a second  queue: the wait queue for the channel.  Instead, we could consider using a larger capacity channel plus  and propagate failure from .As an example, when we use the actor pattern, we typically observe that there’s only one actor and potentially many clients, so there’s not much point in buffering messages  the channel.  So we use  and let clients block in .  But we could instead have  and have clients use  and propagate failure if they’re unable to send the message.  The value  here is pretty arbitrary.  You want it to be large enough to account for an expected amount of client concurrency, but not larger.  If the value is too small, you’ll wind up with spurious failures when the client could have just waited a bit longer.  If the value is too large, you can wind up queueing so much work that the actor is always behind (and clients are potentially even timing out at a higher level).  One might observe:Channel limits, channel limits: always wrong!Some too short and some too long!But as with timeouts, it’s often possible to find values that work in practice.Using  is  a mitigation because this still results in the sender blocking.  It needs to be polled after the timeout expires in order to give up.  But with futurelock, it will never be polled.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Government hackers breached telecom giant Ribbon for months before getting caught</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/31/government-hackers-breached-telecom-giant-ribbon-for-months-before-getting-caught/</link><author>Zack Whittaker</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:45:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ribbon, which provides software and technology to phone and internet giants, said nation-state hackers were in its systems since at least December 2024.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Another European agency shifts off US Tech as digital sovereignty gains steam</title><link>https://www.zdnet.com/article/another-european-agency-ditches-big-tech-as-digital-sovereignty-movement-gains-steam/</link><author>CrankyBear</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 16:39:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Austria's Ministry of Economy has migrated to a Nextcloud platform.It's the latest move in a European trend to shift away from Big Tech.European governments and agencies want to control sensitive data.This shift away from proprietary, foreign-owned cloud services, such as Microsoft 365, to an open-source, European-based cloud service aligns with a growing trend among European governments and agencies. They want control over sensitive data and to declare their independence from US-based tech providers. European companies are encouraging this trend. Many of them have joined forces in the newly created non-profit foundation, the EuroStack Initiative. This foundation's goal is " to organize action, not just talk, around the pillars of the initiative: Buy European, Sell European, Fund European." What's the motive behind these moves away from proprietary tech? Well, in Austria's case, Florian Zinnagl, CISO of the Ministry of Economy, Energy, and Tourism (BMWET), explained, "We carry responsibility for a large amount of sensitive data -- from employees, companies, and citizens. As a public institution, we take this responsibility very seriously. That's why we view it critically to rely on cloud solutions from non-European corporations for processing this information."All of these organizations aim to keep data storage and processing within national or European borders to enhance security, comply with privacy laws such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and mitigate risks from potential commercial and foreign government surveillance. Open-source software is seen as combining the virtues of faster development and better security, while providing companies and governments with more control, as general manager Thierry Carrez of the OpenInfra Foundation recently suggested: "Open infrastructure allows nations and organizations to maintain control over their applications, their data, and their destiny while benefiting from global collaboration."  While the US may not like it, with NextCloud's help, BMWET completed its migration in just four months. Although BMWET had already begun adopting Microsoft 365 and Teams before the project's start, the shift was still considered a success. That's because instead of reversing its path, the ministry implemented a hybrid architecture: Nextcloud handles internal collaboration and secure data management, while Teams remains available for external meetings.The project emphasized integration with existing workflows, including seamless integration with Outlook email and calendar via Sendent's Outlook app. This approach minimized disruption and ensured user acceptance. However, not all migrations progress so well. For example, in Austria, the Ministry of Justice decided to replace Office with LibreOffice. Yet the transition has run into trouble. It appears that the move of 20,000 desktops, which was prompted by a desire to reduce spending on Microsoft licenses, has been, as one person reported, an "unprofessional, rushed operation." Some offices are still on Office, others on LibreOffice, and they're running into incompatible document format problems and misfires in e-mail systems. The moral of the story is that any switch from one software suite to another requires careful handling by the IT department and helpdesk staff. Otherwise, you end up with unhappy users.That said, BMWET's bold shift to Nextcloud appears to have gone well. This initiative demonstrates that adopting sovereign cloud solutions can be practical, user-friendly, and rapid in the public sector.

A simple and amenable to analytical treatment semiclassical calculation can be performed in the regime mL ≫ 1 where m is a mass of the conjectured dual bulk fermion [28, 29]. In this regime, the fermion’s paths contributing to various quantum-mechanical amplitudes follow closely the classical boundary-to-boundary trajectories (geodesics) derived from the (imaginary-time) action\
by varying over τ(u) and r(u).\
Evaluating this action on its geodesic one obtains\
While an explicit analytic computation of (29) can only be performed in some special cases, the one-parameter space/time dependencies can be readily found for a broad variety of metrics. Specifically, for the HV metric (26) one obtains [29, 30]\
Notably, in the absence of hyperscaling violation (θ = 0) both these asymptotics become either constant (less likely) or logarithmic (more likely, see below). Thus, if the classical EMD Lagrangian (22) were to represent a valid bulk dual of a boundary theory with the gauge-like interaction (1) the asymptotics (31) would not be readily reconcilable with the eikonal/bosonization results (11,21) which depend primarily on z (via η) rather than θ.\
and is composed of the two independent solutions which read\
Imposing the proper boundary conditions and following the holographic dictionary [26] one then defines the propagator as a reflection coefficient for the wave incident at the boundary\
A different behavior (unattainable in the case of a HV metric (26) with finite z and θ) occurs for α = β + 1 in which case the integral in (33) diverges at u → 0. This peculiar NFL regime, dubbed ’local criticality’, is characterized by the propagator\
where a(k), b(k), and ν(k) ∼ k are non-singular functions of momentum that can, in general, produce multiple poles identified as the distinct (’fractionalized’) FS [28].\
Fourier transforming (36) is complicated by the fact that G(ω, k) is not analytically known across the entire range of its arguments. However, the fast (and/or furious) Fourier transformation via a saddle point suggests the following form of this function in the spacetime domain\
Adding to the intrigue, there are some recent Monte Carlo results on the 2d Hubbard and t − J models that have long been thought to represent the prototypical NFL normal state in the cuprates. These results do not readily conform to a momentum-independent, yet strongly energy-dependent, self-energy function, showing less of energy/temperature dependence than any of the above expressions [33]. It remains to be seen as to what this might imply for the general applicability of the theories of fermions (’spinons’) governed by the interactions (1) to the analysis of those microscopic models.(1) D.

Those few holographic exercises that do occasionally pop out still tend to begin with the mantra ’holography is well known to be an established method for studying strongly correlated systems’. However, this optimistic reassurance often appears to be in a rather stark contrast with the typical summary that sounds more like ’as no unambiguous agreement with experiment was found, the problem is left to future work’.\
Also, much of the original thrust towards boldly treating an arbitrary condensed matter system of interest as yet another application of some opportunistically chosen weakly-coupled semiclassical gravity has retreated into a ’safer-haven’ topic of hydrodynamics (which, while highlighted and revitalized by holography, can be - and of course had long been - successfully discussed without ever mentioning the latter).\
On the outside, it may seem as though the heuristic ’holo-hacking’ (a.k.a. ’bottom up’ or ’non-AdS/nonCFT’) approach tends to pick out its favorite gravity-like bulk theory on the basis of such physically compelling reasons as an existence of the previously found classical solutions and normal modes’ spectra, availability of the numerical simulation software, or mere need to engage students with the tangible computational tasks.\
However, apart from having become a massive and customary practice, there hasn’t been much effort made towards any serious justification of neither the overall holographic scheme, nor its specific ’dictionary’ which was copy-pasted from the original string-theoretical framework. In that regard, it might be worth keeping in mind that just because everyone else on a highway may be driving above the posted speed limit does not by itself make it legal.\
In light of the above, comparing holographic propagators to the predictions of other techniques could provide an additional testing ground for, both, the alternate methods as well as the holographic approach itself. the bulk metric, gauge, and scalar (dilaton) fields [26]\
Among all the classical solutions of the theory (22) there is a special class of Lifshitz metrics (θ = 0) which were discovered in the semiclassical (ThomasFermi) analysis of matter back-reaction on the metric, as well as in the ’electron star’ scenarios, etc. [27].\
More generally, any viable solutions of (22) must obey certain stability (’null energy’) conditions [26](1) D. V.

It takes a LOT of manual work.So, we save you 20+ hours per week by finding every affiliate currently promoting your competitors so you can recruit them, as well as all the top influencers and creators in your niche to build partnerships with.3. What do you love about your team, and why are you the ones to solve this problem?We’re a team of people who all have a LOT of experience in affiliate marketing - either as affiliate marketers ourselves, or as affiliate managers. We get the industry.We know how time-consuming it is to search for new affiliates all the time - and we literally built AffiliateFinder.ai to solve our own problem while running our affiliate management agency! We know what we want in a software like this, so we feel we know exactly how to build this to solve other people having similar problems.4. If you weren’t building your startup, what would you be doing?Probably building a different startup! I really enjoy the game, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.5. At the moment, how do you measure success? What are your metrics?Product feedback, customer growth, and retention. If we don’t have a good product, people will not complete their 7-day free trial, and we won’t grow customers or revenue. Everything we’re focused on now is around retention, and not just building something they’ll use once to get a list of affiliates, but how to make this incredibly helpful as an ongoing companion for all your partner management work.6. In a few sentences, what do you offer to whom?AffiliateFinder.ai helps affiliate, influencer, and partnerships teams 3x their affiliate recruitment by finding all the best-fit potential affiliates for them - and ordering them by priority so they can start with the absolute top partners.We save you 20+ hours per week of boring, manual research - freeing you up to focus on building those relationships with affiliates so they can send you sales while you sleep.It works great, no matter what type of business you are: B2B SaaS, AI, DTC/ecom, travel, iGaming, fintech and trading - we have many customers across all types of businesses.7. What’s most exciting about your traction to date?We’re used by several of the largest companies in the world. It’s always validating when multi-billion dollar companies use your tool and find it valuable enough to use and pay for!And, surprisingly, some of our first customers were forward-thinking managers at these huge companies - they saw our product and instantly understood how it could help them scale their affiliate revenue and outcompete their competition.8. Where do you think your growth will be next year?We’d like to reach 2,000 paying customers by the end of next year, and we’re building to hit that right now.If we can help those 2,000 brands reach their goals by recruiting more partners - then we’ll be extremely happy. We have a lot of great products and features we want to build out, and we’re very excited to build these for the world.9. Tell us about your first paying customer and revenue expectations over the next year.It took us a while to get our first paying customer - a good few months from launch.We originally launched with a freemium option where you’d get your first 15 affiliates for free, and then you had to upgrade yourself to get the full version. But nobody was upgrading!Once we switched to a 7-day free trial, the customers started rolling in.10. What’s your biggest threat?We’re an AI-powered tool, and we use AI to filter out bad-fit affiliates - and recommend the good fits. But, naturally, if there is an extremely advanced AI that can eventually do this all, then this is a huge threat to us. But, we’re working on custom data to make us the most useful tool in affiliate marketing. That hopefully keeps our competitive advantage as AI improves.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Construct Koin Plans to Bridge a $300 Trillion Market Gap in Real Estate Financing</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/how-construct-koin-plans-to-bridge-a-$300-trillion-market-gap-in-real-estate-financing?source=rss</link><author>Ishan Pandey</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 14:03:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Can blockchain technology solve century-old problems in real estate financing, or does it represent another attempt to apply a solution in search of a problem?The question becomes more pressing as Construct Koin launches a presale that aims to raise $100 million by offering tokens that start at $0.10 and scale to $1 across 10 phases. The project positions itself as a Real Estate Financing (ReFi) protocol that will modernize how capital flows into property development, but the proof will depend on whether it can deliver where others have failed.\
The timing appears calculated. The tokenized real-world asset market crossed $30 billion in 2025, a figure that reflects roughly a 10-fold increase from 2022 levels. Private credit accounts for approximately $17 billion of this total, while U.S. Treasuries make up $7.3 billion. The momentum suggests that institutions are finding utility in blockchain infrastructure for specific use cases, particularly those involving yield-bearing assets with standardized documentation.Understanding ReFi and What Construct Koin Actually DoesReal Estate Financing through blockchain differs from the property tokenization projects that dominated headlines in previous cycles. Instead of selling fractional ownership in buildings, ReFi protocols focus on the financing process itself. Think of it as digitizing the loan origination and management workflow rather than the asset title.\
Construct Koin operates by connecting property developers who need capital with investors who provide it through token purchases. The platform claims to use artificial intelligence integrated with Building Information Management (BIM) software to analyze development proposals and make lending decisions in hours rather than the weeks or months typical in traditional finance. According to the project website, loans are secured by legal charges registered on title deeds with HM Land Registry in the UK, providing a layer of protection through real property collateral.\
The mechanics work through a loan book model. When developers borrow funds, they pay interest and profit shares back to the protocol. CTK token holders who stake their tokens receive 8 to 12% annual percentage rates paid in USDT stablecoin. The protocol claims it currently has £15 million of assets already secured on-chain, though independent verification of this figure through public blockchain explorers remains limited in available documentation.Breaking Down the $100 Million Presale StructureThe fundraising approach spans 10 phases, each with a price increment. The first phase opened at $0.10 per token, and the final phase will close at $1.00 per token at the Token Generation Event (TGE). The model resembles how venture capital rounds work, with later participants paying higher prices than earlier ones. Out of the 1 billion total token supply, 400 million tokens have been allocated to the presale.\
This represents 40% of the total supply going to public participants. Another 15% has been earmarked for staking rewards, 20% for ecosystem growth, 15% for team and advisors, and 10% for liquidity and reserves. The vesting schedules for team tokens matter here, though specific timeframes were not detailed in the publicly available documentation. Projects that allow insiders to sell immediately after launch have historically faced selling pressure that can depress token prices.\
The presale accepts payments through both fiat channels (credit cards, bank transfers) and six major cryptocurrency networks including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain. Minimum purchase amounts vary by network due to transaction fee structures. Ethereum requires a $100 minimum due to higher gas fees, while networks like Polygon and Solana allow $10 minimum purchases. The tokens will remain locked until TGE, which the project estimates will occur 12 to 24 months from launch.The Technology Stack and AI ClaimsThe project emphasizes its use of AI for underwriting decisions. Traditional property development loans can take weeks or months to process as lenders manually review business plans, financial projections, and construction documents. Construct Koin claims its system achieves a 95% speed improvement by automating this analysis through machine learning models that assess risk based on multiple data points.\
The integration with BIM systems provides the AI with access to architectural plans, material specifications, and construction schedules. In theory, this allows the algorithm to evaluate whether a project is feasible, properly costed, and likely to complete on time. The platform processes applications and provides offers in hours rather than weeks, according to marketing materials. However, the details about which specific AI models are being used, what training data they rely on, and how they handle edge cases remain undisclosed.\
The technical infrastructure runs on Ethereum as an ERC-20 token. The smart contracts are described as audited, though the names of the audit firms and links to audit reports were not prominently featured in the reviewed materials. The choice of Ethereum provides compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure and wallet solutions, but it also means users will contend with network congestion and variable transaction fees unless they utilize Layer 2 solutions.Market Context and the RWA SurgeUnderstanding where Construct Koin fits requires context about the broader real-world asset tokenization movement. The sector experienced 380% growth over three years, reaching $24 billion by mid-2025 according to a report by RedStone, Gauntlet, and RWA.xyz. This represents a shift from experimental pilots to scaled institutional adoption, particularly in fixed income and private credit categories.\
Major financial institutions have entered the space. BlackRock launched a $2.9 billion tokenized fund (BUIDL), while Franklin Templeton's tokenized money market fund represents $420 million in assets. Goldman Sachs partnered with BNY Mellon to tokenize money market funds, supported by regulatory frameworks that aim to streamline settlement and reduce costs. The institutional involvement provides validation that blockchain infrastructure can solve real operational problems in capital markets.Who is Building This and Corporate StructureChris Baldrey-Chouro serves as CEO and founder of Construct Koin. According to a podcast interview on The Crypto Podcast, Baldrey-Chouro describes the project as executing "one of the most innovative fundraising strategies in crypto history." His background includes work in recruitment and staffing solutions for commerce, based on corporate registry information.\
This multi-jurisdictional setup is common among crypto projects seeking to optimize for regulatory environments while maintaining operational flexibility. The UK entity provides legitimacy through Companies House registration and operates under UK corporate law. The BVI structure offers advantages for token operations, while the Dubai presence targets the Middle East market, which represents over $2 trillion in real estate value according to project materials.The project positions itself as compliance-first, a pitch aimed at institutional allocators who need legal clarity before committing capital. The protocol includes KYC and AML requirements for all investors, with enhanced due diligence for purchases exceeding $10,000. This approach contrasts with many DeFi protocols that operate pseudonymously or with minimal identity verification.\
The emphasis on milestone-driven disbursements and oracle-verified events addresses one of the key concerns institutional investors have about blockchain-based financing. Traditional tranche financing releases funds only after borrowers meet specific milestones such as completing foundation work or reaching specific construction stages. Construct Koin claims its smart contracts replicate this structure by releasing capital only after verification of progress, reducing the risk of fund misuse.\
The security model relies on conservative loan-to-value ratios of 60 to 70%. This means if a developer defaults, the property securing the loan should be worth significantly more than the outstanding debt, allowing the protocol to recover funds through foreclosure and sale. The protocol also maintains an insurance vault funded by a portion of fees to cover defaults beyond normal parameters. Whether these mechanisms will perform as designed during an actual default scenario remains untested.The Presale Risk Landscape in 2025\
Common red flags in presales include anonymous teams, unrealistic return promises, poorly written whitepapers, unclear tokenomics, and lack of transparency about milestones. Legitimate projects typically disclose team identities, provide detailed technical documentation, show clear roadmaps, and communicate regularly about progress. Projects that lack these elements often disappear after raising funds, leaving investors with worthless tokens.\
The regulatory environment adds another layer of complexity. Crypto projects face scrutiny about whether their tokens constitute securities under various jurisdictions. The classification determines which regulations apply and what disclosures are required. Projects that ignore legal frameworks or operate without proper licensing expose themselves and their investors to enforcement actions, frozen assets, and potential criminal charges.Real Estate Tokenization Track RecordThe history of real estate tokenization projects provides lessons. Multiple ventures have attempted to bring property onto blockchain with mixed results. Early projects focused on fractional ownership, allowing investors to buy shares in specific buildings. These faced challenges with liquidity, regulatory compliance, and the complexity of managing physical assets through digital interfaces.\
More recent projects have shifted toward the financing layer rather than ownership tokenization. This approach encounters fewer regulatory hurdles since it deals with loan products rather than securities representing property ownership. However, the business model still requires borrowers, which means projects must build relationships with developers and prove they can provide capital at competitive rates.\
The question of whether blockchain adds genuine value or merely adds complexity remains contentious. Supporters argue that on-chain transparency, programmable terms, and global capital access justify the technology overhead. Critics point out that traditional finance already has efficient systems for real estate lending and that blockchain's benefits are often overstated relative to implementation costs.Several execution risks warrant examination. First, the loan book model requires a steady pipeline of creditworthy borrowers. If developers can obtain financing through traditional channels at lower costs, they have little incentive to use a new platform that charges fees. The project must either offer better terms than banks or target developers who cannot access traditional financing, which introduces credit risk.\
Second, the AI underwriting system remains largely unproven at scale. While automation can speed processes, it also concentrates risk if the algorithms make systematic errors. A series of bad loans could deplete the insurance fund and leave token holders with losses. The lack of detailed information about the AI's training data, error rates, and decision-making process makes it difficult to assess this risk.\
Third, regulatory changes could impact operations. Governments continue to develop frameworks for crypto assets and tokenized securities. A regulatory crackdown in key markets could force the project to halt operations, delist from exchanges, or face enforcement actions. The multi-jurisdictional structure provides some flexibility but also creates compliance complexity across multiple legal systems.\
Fourth, the token economics depend on sustained borrower demand and investor interest. If loan volume does not grow as projected, staking rewards may decline, reducing demand for the token. If token prices fall significantly below the purchase price, early investors may become discouraged and sell, creating additional downward pressure. The long lock-up period until TGE means investors cannot exit if circumstances change.Looking at established players in the space provides benchmarks. Centrifuge has achieved $1 billion in Total Value Locked, making it the third RWA protocol to reach this milestone. The platform tokenizes invoices, receivables, and trade finance instruments, pushing them into DeFi markets as collateral. Centrifuge completed a V3 migration in 2025, delivering multichain infrastructure across six EVM chains.\
Ondo Finance focuses on institutional-grade tokenized securities and has built infrastructure for bringing fixed-income products on-chain. The platform emphasizes compliance and works within regulatory frameworks rather than attempting to circumvent them. This approach has allowed Ondo to partner with traditional financial institutions and build sustainable business models.\
The difference between these established protocols and a new entrant like Construct Koin lies in track record. Centrifuge and Ondo have processed real transactions, demonstrated their technology works, and built reputations over multiple years. They have also secured institutional backing and navigated regulatory processes. Construct Koin must still prove it can execute its vision and deliver returns to token holders.What The Numbers Actually ShowThe project claims £15 million in assets already secured on-chain. Converting to dollars at current exchange rates gives approximately $19 million in collateral backing the protocol before the presale completes. If the presale reaches its $100 million target, the ratio of raised capital to existing collateral will be roughly 5 to 1. This means the project would need to deploy the raised funds into new loans relatively quickly to maintain proportional backing.\
The staking rewards of 8 to 12% APR paid in USDT require generating sufficient revenue from loan interest and fees. If the protocol charges borrowers 7 to 15% annual interest, as stated in marketing materials, the math works if the majority of loans perform and default rates remain low. However, a 10% default rate combined with recovery costs could quickly consume the margin between what borrowers pay and what stakers receive.\
The tokenomics allocate 15% of supply for staking rewards. With 1 billion total tokens, this equals 150 million tokens reserved for rewards. If tokens reach $1 at TGE as the presale structure suggests, that represents $150 million in value designated for staking. Paying 12% APR on a pool of staked tokens would require substantial protocol revenue, meaning the loan book must grow significantly to sustain these yields.The Bigger Picture: Does ReFi Have Product-Market Fit?The core question is whether blockchain-based real estate financing solves problems that matter to enough participants to create a sustainable market. Developers need capital, and investors want returns. Traditional systems provide both, albeit with friction from intermediaries, paperwork, and slow processes.\
Blockchain's value proposition centers on disintermediation, transparency, and global access. By removing middlemen, protocols can theoretically offer borrowers lower rates and investors higher yields. By recording transactions on-chain, all parties can audit the state of loans in real-time. By operating globally, capital can flow from anywhere to anywhere, removing geographical barriers.\
The counterargument is that the friction in traditional finance exists for reasons. Paperwork and slow processes often serve as risk management mechanisms that prevent bad deals from proceeding. Intermediaries like banks provide expertise in underwriting, legal structuring, and recovery that algorithmic systems may struggle to replicate. Global capital flows sound attractive until investors face losses in foreign jurisdictions where recovering assets is difficult or impossible.After examining the available information about Construct Koin, the project represents both the promise and peril of real-world asset tokenization in its current phase. The promise lies in the genuine growth of the RWA sector, which has demonstrated that certain use cases have found product-market fit. The peril comes from execution risk, regulatory uncertainty, and the long history of crypto projects that fail to deliver on ambitious visions.\
The data points to consider are straightforward. The RWA market is real and growing, reaching $30 billion with institutional participation from major financial players. Real estate represents the largest asset class globally at over $300 trillion, meaning even a tiny percentage of tokenization would create enormous value. The technology for tokenizing loans and managing them through smart contracts exists and has been deployed by other projects successfully.\
Against this, the presale model concentrates risk on early participants who must wait 12 to 24 months for tokens to unlock while hoping the project executes. The team, while public, does not appear to have prior experience building DeFi protocols or managing large-scale lending operations. The AI claims lack substantiation through independent testing or published benchmarks. The regulatory landscape remains fluid, with governments still determining how to classify and regulate tokenized assets.\
The honest assessment is that Construct Koin is attempting something difficult that, if successful, could generate returns for early participants. It is also attempting something that could fail for multiple reasons including poor execution, regulatory intervention, lack of borrower adoption, or macroeconomic changes that reduce demand for real estate development financing. Potential participants should view this as a high-risk investment where capital loss is a realistic outcome, not merely a theoretical possibility disclosed in legal disclaimers.\
The project would benefit from greater transparency about its AI technology, more detailed disclosure of its existing loan book, and clearer communication about partnerships with developers who will actually use the platform. Without these elements, investors are essentially betting on a vision backed by marketing materials rather than proven operational metrics.\
In a market where over half of projects fail, the bar for success is high. Whether Construct Koin clears that bar will depend on execution over the coming years, not on the quality of its presale marketing or the size of its fundraising target.\

While the Moldovan capital Chişinău tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia – despite problems like Transnistria's deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. 

Until the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act – as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  

While pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU.

Your brain might seem foggy, and your mind drifts off when you should be paying attention.A new study from MIT reveals what happens inside the brain as these momentary failures of attention occur. The scientists found that during these lapses, a wave of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flows out of the brain — a process that typically occurs during sleep and helps to wash away waste products that have built up during the day. This flushing is believed to be necessary for maintaining a healthy, normally functioning brain.When a person is sleep-deprived, it appears that their body attempts to catch up on this cleansing process by initiating pulses of CSF flow. However, this comes at a cost of dramatically impaired attention.“If you don’t sleep, the CSF waves start to intrude into wakefulness where normally you wouldn’t see them. However, they come with an attentional tradeoff, where attention fails during the moments that you have this wave of fluid flow,” says Laura Lewis, the Athinoula A. Martinos Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science and the Research Laboratory of Electronics, and an associate member of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory.Lewis is the senior author of the study, which appears today in . MIT visiting graduate student Zinong Yang is the lead author of the paper.Although sleep is a critical biological process, it’s not known exactly why it is so important. It appears to be essential for maintaining alertness, and it has been well-documented that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of attention and other cognitive functions.During sleep, the cerebrospinal fluid that cushions the brain helps to remove waste that has built up during the day. In a 2019 study, Lewis and colleagues showed that CSF flow during sleep follows a rhythmic pattern in and out of the brain, and that these flows are linked to changes in brain waves during sleep.That finding led Lewis to wonder what might happen to CSF flow after sleep deprivation. To explore that question, she and her colleagues recruited 26 volunteers who were tested twice — once following a night of sleep deprivation in the lab, and once when they were well-rested.In the morning, the researchers monitored several different measures of brain and body function as the participants performed a task that is commonly used to evaluate the effects of sleep deprivation.During the task, each participant wore an electroencephalogram (EEG) cap that could record brain waves while they were also in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner. The researchers used a modified version of fMRI that allowed them to measure not only blood oxygenation in the brain, but also the flow of CSF in and out of the brain. They also measured each subject’s heart rate, breathing rate, and pupil diameter.The participants performed two attentional tasks while in the fMRI scanner, one visual and one auditory. For the visual task, they had to look at a screen that had a fixed cross. At random intervals, the cross would turn into a square, and the participants were told to press a button whenever they saw this happen. For the auditory task, they would hear a beep instead of seeing a visual transformation.Sleep-deprived participants performed much worse than well-rested participants on these tasks, as expected. Their response times were slower, and for some of the stimuli, the participants never registered the change at all.During these momentary lapses of attention, the researchers identified several physiological changes that occurred at the same time. Most significantly, they found a flux of CSF out of the brain just as those lapses occurred. After each lapse, CSF flowed back into the brain.“The results are suggesting that at the moment that attention fails, this fluid is actually being expelled outward away from the brain. And when attention recovers, it’s drawn back in,” Lewis says.The researchers hypothesize that when the brain is sleep-deprived, it begins to compensate for the loss of the cleansing that normally occurs during sleep, even though these pulses of CSF flow come with the cost of attention loss.“One way to think about those events is because your brain is so in need of sleep, it tries its best to enter into a sleep-like state to restore some cognitive functions,” Yang says. “Your brain’s fluid system is trying to restore function by pushing the brain to iterate between high-attention and high-flow states.”The researchers also found several other physiological events linked to attentional lapses, including decreases in breathing and heart rate, along with constriction of the pupils. They found that pupil constriction began about 12 seconds before CSF flowed out of the brain, and pupils dilated again after the attentional lapse.“What’s interesting is it seems like this isn’t just a phenomenon in the brain, it’s also a body-wide event. It suggests that there’s a tight coordination of these systems, where when your attention fails, you might feel it perceptually and psychologically, but it’s also reflecting an event that’s happening throughout the brain and body,” Lewis says.This close linkage between disparate events may indicate that there is a single circuit that controls both attention and bodily functions such as fluid flow, heart rate, and arousal, according to the researchers.“These results suggest to us that there’s a unified circuit that’s governing both what we think of as very high-level functions of the brain — our attention, our ability to perceive and respond to the world — and then also really basic fundamental physiological processes like fluid dynamics of the brain, brain-wide blood flow, and blood vessel constriction,” Lewis says.In this study, the researchers did not explore what circuit might be controlling this switching, but one good candidate, they say, is the noradrenergic system. Recent research has shown that this system, which regulates many cognitive and bodily functions through the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, oscillates during normal sleep.The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health, a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Research Fellowship, a NAWA Fellowship, a McKnight Scholar Award, a Sloan Fellowship, a Pew Biomedical Scholar Award, a One Mind Rising Star Award, and the Simons Collaboration on Plasticity in the Aging Brain.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise</title><link>https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html</link><author>reaperducer</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:03:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, says that technological revolutions are driven by more than just technology. They are also driven, he argues, by new ways of paying for them.“There is always a lot of focus on technological innovation. What really drives a lot of progress is when people also figure out how to innovate on the financial model,” he recently said at the site of a data center that OpenAI is building in Abilene, Texas.Over the last several years, Mr. Altman’s company has found unusual and creative ways of paying for the computing power needed to fuel its ambitions.Many of the deals OpenAI has struck — with chipmakers, cloud computing companies and others — are strangely circular. OpenAI receives billions from tech companies before sending those billions back to the same companies to pay for computing power and other services.Industry experts and financial analysts have welcomed the start-up’s creativity. But these unorthodox arrangements have also fueled concerns that OpenAI is helping to inflate a potential financial bubble as it builds what is still a highly speculative technology.Here are unusual financial agreements helping to drive the ambitions of OpenAI, the poster child of the artificial intelligence revolution.From 2019 through 2023, Microsoft was OpenAI’s primary investor. The tech giant pumped more than  into the start-up. Then OpenAI funneled most of those billions back into Microsoft, buying  needed to fuel the development of new A.I. technologies.(The New York Times has sued OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming copyright infringement of news content related to A.I. systems. The two companies have denied the suit’s claims.)By the summer of last year, OpenAI could not get all the computing power it wanted from Microsoft. So it started signing cloud computing contracts with other companies, including Oracle and little-known start-ups with names like CoreWeave.Across three different deals signed this year, OpenAI agreed to pay CoreWeave, a company that builds A.I. data centers, more than  for computing power. As part of these agreements, OpenAI received  in CoreWeave stock, which could ultimately help pay for this computing power.OpenAI also struggled to get the additional investment dollars it wanted from Microsoft. So, it turned to other investors. Earlier this year, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank led a  investment in OpenAI.At the same time, OpenAI has been working with various companies to build its own computing data centers, rather than rely on cloud computing deals. This also includes SoftBank, which is known for highly speculative technological bets that don’t always pay off. The company is raising  to help OpenAI build data centers in Texas and Ohio.Similarly, Oracle, a software and cloud computing giant, has agreed to spend  building new data centers for OpenAI in Texas, New Mexico, Michigan and Wisconsin. OpenAI will then pay Oracle roughly the same amount to use these  over the next several years.The United Arab Emirates was part of an OpenAI’s fund-raising round in October 2024. Now, G42, a firm with close ties to the Emirati government, is building a roughly  for OpenAI in the Emirates.Last month, Nvidia announced that it intended to invest  in OpenAI over the next several years. This could help OpenAI pay for its new data centers. As OpenAI buys or leases specialized chips from Nvidia, Nvidia will pump billions back into OpenAI.Two weeks later, OpenAI signed an agreement with AMD that allows OpenAI to buy up to  in the chipmaker at a penny per share. That translates to roughly a 10 percent stake in the company. This stock could supply OpenAI with additional capital as it works to build new data centers.OpenAI pulls in billions of dollars in revenue each year from customers who pay for ChatGPT, computer programming tools and other technologies. But it still loses more money than it makes, according to a person familiar with the company’s finances.If the company can use its new data centers to significantly improve A.I. technologies and expand its revenue over the next several years, it can become a viable business, as Mr. Altman believes it will. If technology progress stalls, OpenAI – and its many partners – could lose enormous amounts of money. Smaller companies like CoreWeave, which are taking on enormous amounts of debt to build new data centers, could go bankrupt.In some cases, companies are hedging their bets. Nvidia and AMD, for instance, have the option of reducing the cash and stock they send to OpenAI if the A.I. market does not expand as quickly as expected. But others would be left with enormous debt, which could send ripples across the larger economy.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How therapy-speak can be more harmful than helpful #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/14v-sAUsn4g</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/14v-sAUsn4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 13:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Gaslighting. Narcissist. You’ve probably heard these terms used a lot more frequently in recent years. They’re pop psychology terms, also known as therapy-speak, and they’ve become increasingly common in our mainstream vernacular. But oftentimes, people misuse the terminology and let it serve as a blanket term for more complex thoughts and feelings, making it more difficult to receive proper mental health support for clinical diagnoses. Vox correspondent Allie Volpe explains why therapy-speak is so alluring, and how to use more words, not fewer, to describe a situation.

Such passports display a small symbol indicating an electronic machine-readable travel document (eMRTD), which digitally stores the same personal data printed in traditional passport booklets in its embedded filesystem. Beyond allowing travelers in some countries to skip a chat at border control, these documents use cryptography to prevent unauthorized reading, eavesdropping, forgery, and copying.This blog post describes how electronic passports work, the threats within their threat model, and how they protect against those threats using cryptography. It also discusses the implications of using electronic passports for novel applications, such as zero-knowledge identity proofs. Like many widely used electronic devices with long lifetimes, electronic passports and the systems interacting with them support insecure, legacy protocols that put passport holders at risk for both standard and novel use cases.Electronic passport basicsA passport serves as official identity documentation, primarily for international travel. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines the standards for electronic passports, which (as suggested by the “Chip Inside” symbol) contain a contactless integrated circuit (IC) storing digital information. Essentially, the chip contains a filesystem with some access control to protect unauthorized reading of data. The full technical details of electronic passports are specified in ICAO Doc 9303; this blog post will mostly focus on part 10, which specifies the logical data structure (LDS), and part 11, which specifies the security mechanisms.The filesystem architecture is straightforward, comprising three file types: master files (MFs) serving as the root directory; dedicated files (DFs) functioning as subdirectories or applications; and elementary files (EFs) containing actual binary data. As shown in the above figure, some files are mandatory, whereas others are optional. This blog post will focus on the eMRTD application. The other applications are part of LDS 2.0, which would allow the digital storage of travel records (digital stamps!), electronic visas, and additional biometrics (so you can just update your picture instead of getting a whole new passport!).How the eMRTD application worksThe following figure shows the types of files the eMRTD contains:There are generic files containing common or security-related data; all other files are so-called data groups (DGs), which primarily contain personal information (most of which is also printed on your passport) and some additional security data that will become important later. All electronic passports must contain DGs 1 and 2, whereas the rest is optional.Comparing the contents of DG1 and DG2 to the main passport page shows that most of the written data is stored in DG1 and the photo is stored in DG2. Additionally, there are two lines of characters at the bottom of the page called the machine readable zone (MRZ), which contains another copy of the DG1 data with some check digits, as shown in the following picture.Digging into the threat modelElectronic passports operate under a straightforward threat model that categorizes attackers based on physical access: those who hold a passport versus those who don’t. If you are near a passport but you do not hold it in your possession, you should not be able to do any of the following:Read any personal information from that passportEavesdrop on communication that the passport has with legitimate terminalsFigure out whether it is a specific passport so you can trace its movementsEven if you do hold one or more passports, you should not be able to do the following:Forge a new passport with inauthentic dataMake a digital copy of the passportRead the fingerprint (DG3) or iris (DG4) informationElectronic passports use short-range RFID for communication (ISO 14443). You can communicate with a passport within a distance of 10–15 centimeters, but eavesdropping is possible at distances of several meters. Because electronic passports are embedded devices, they need to be able to withstand attacks where the attacker has physical access to the device, such as elaborate side-channel and fault injection attacks. As a result, they are often certified (e.g., under Common Criteria).We focus here on the threats against the electronic components of the passport. Passports have many physical countermeasures, such as visual effects that become visible under certain types of light. Even if someone can break the electronic security that prevents copying passports, they would still have to defeat these physical measures to make a full copy of the passport. That said, some systems (such as online systems) only interact digitally with the passport, so they do not perform any physical checks at all.The earliest electronic passports lacked most cryptographic mechanisms. Malaysia issued the first electronic passport in 1998, which predates the first ICAO eMRTD specifications from 2003. Belgium subsequently issued the first ICAO-compliant eMRTD in 2004, which in turn predates the first cryptographic mechanism for confidentiality specified in 2005.While we could focus solely on the most advanced cryptographic implementations, electronic passports remain in circulation for extended periods (typically 5–10 years), meaning legacy systems continue operating alongside modern solutions. This means that there are typically many old passports floating around that do not support the latest and greatest access control mechanisms. Similarly, not all inspection systems/terminals support all of the protocols, which means passports potentially need to support multiple protocols. All protocols discussed in the following are described in more detail in ICAO Doc 9303 Part 11.Legacy protection mechanisms for electronic passports provide better security than what they were replacing (nothing), even though they have key shortcomings regarding confidentiality and (to a lesser extent) copying.Legacy confidentiality protections: How basic access control failsIn order to prevent eavesdropping, you need to set up a secure channel. Typically, this is done by deriving a shared symmetric key, either from some shared knowledge, or through a key exchange. However, the passport cannot have its own static public key and send it over the communication channel, because this would enable tracing of specific passports.Additionally, it should only be possible to set up this secure channel if you have the passport in your possession. So, what sets holders apart from others? Holders can read the physical passport page that contains the MRZ!This brings us to the original solution to set up a secure channel with electronic passports: basic access control (BAC). When you place your passport with the photo page face down into an inspection system at the airport, it scans the page and reads the MRZ. Now, both sides derive encryption and message authentication code (MAC) keys from parts of the MRZ data using SHA-1 as a KDF. Then, they exchange freshly generated challenges and encrypt-then-MAC these challenges together with some fresh keying material to prove that both sides know the key. Finally, they derive session keys from the keying material and use them to set up the secure channel.However, BAC fails to achieve any of its security objectives. The static MRZ is just some personal data and does not have very high entropy, which makes it guessable. Even worse, if you capture one valid exchange between passport and terminal, you can brute-force the MRZ offline by computing a bunch of unhardened hashes. Moreover, passive listeners who know the MRZ can decrypt all communications with the passport. Finally, the fact that the passport has to check both the MAC and the challenge has opened up the potential for oracle attacks that allow tracing by replaying valid terminal responses.Forgery prevention: Got it right the first timePreventing forgery is relatively simple. The passport contains a file called the Document Security Object (EF.SOD), which contains a list of hashes of all the Data Groups, and a signature over all these hashes. This signature comes from a key pair that has a certificate chain back to the Country Signing Certificate Authority (CSCA). The private key associated with the CSCA certificate is one of the most valuable assets in this system, because anyone in possession of this private key can issue legitimate passports containing arbitrary data.The process of reading the passport, comparing all contents to the SOD, and verifying the signature and certificate chain is called passive authentication (PA). This will prove that the data in the passport was signed by the issuing country. However, it does nothing to prevent the copying of existing passports: anyone who can read a passport can copy its data into a new chip and it will pass PA. While this mechanism is listed among the legacy ones, it meets all of its objectives and is therefore still used without changes.Legacy copying protections: They work, but some issues remainPreventing copying requires having something in the passport that cannot be read or extracted, like the private key of a key pair. But how does a terminal know that a key pair belongs to a genuine passport? Since countries are already signing the contents of the passport for PA, they can just put the public key in one of the data groups (DG15), and use the private key to sign challenges that the terminal sends. This is called active authentication (AA). After performing both PA and AA, the terminal knows that the data in the passport (including the AA public key) was signed by the government and that the passport contains the corresponding private key.This solution has two issues: the AA signature is not tied to the secure channel, so you can relay a signature and pretend that the passport is somewhere it’s not. Additionally, the passport signs an arbitrary challenge without knowing the semantics of this message, which is generally considered a dangerous practice in cryptography.Extended Access Control (EAC) fixes some of the issues related to BAC and AA. It comprises chip authentication (CA), which is a better AA, and terminal authentication (TA), which authenticates the terminal to the passport in order to protect access to the sensitive information stored in DG3 (fingerprint) and DG4 (iris). Finally, password authenticated connection establishment (PACE, described below) replaces BAC altogether, eliminating its weaknesses.Chip Authentication: Upgrading the secure channelCA is very similar to AA in the sense that it requires countries to simply store a public key in one of the DGs (DG14), which is then authenticated using PA. However, instead of signing a challenge, the passport uses the key pair to perform a static-ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the terminal, and uses the resulting keys to upgrade the secure channel from BAC. This means that passive listeners that know the MRZ cannot eavesdrop after doing CA, because they were not part of the key exchange.Terminal Authentication: Protecting sensitive data in DG3 and DG4Similar to the CSCA for signing things, each country has a Country Verification Certificate Authority (CVCA), which creates a root certificate for a PKI that authorizes terminals to read DG3 and DG4 in the passports of that country. Terminals provide a certificate chain for their public key and sign a challenge provided by the passport using their private key. The CVCA can authorize document verifiers (DVs) to read one or both of DG3 and DG4, which is encoded in the certificate. The DV then issues certificates to individual terminals. Without such a certificate, it is not possible to access the sensitive data in DG3 and DG4.Password Authenticated Connection Establishment: Fixing the basic problemsThe main idea behind PACE is that the MRZ, much like a password, does not have sufficient entropy to protect the data it contains. Therefore, it should not be used directly to derive keys, because this would enable offline brute-force attacks. PACE can work with various mappings, but we describe only the simplest one in the following, which is the generic mapping. Likewise, PACE can work with other passwords besides the MRZ (such as a PIN), but this blog post focuses on the MRZ.First, both sides use the MRZ data (the password) to derive a password key. Next, the passport encrypts a nonce using the password key and sends it to the terminal, which can decrypt it if it knows the password. The terminal and passport also perform an ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Now, both terminal and passport derive a new generator of the elliptic curve by applying the nonce as an additive tweak to the (EC)DH shared secret. Using this new generator, the terminal and passport perform another (EC)DH to get a second shared secret. Finally, they use this second shared secret to derive session keys, which are used to authenticate the (EC)DH public keys that they used earlier on in the protocol, and to set up the secure channel. Figure 6 shows a simplified protocol diagram.Anyone who does not know the password cannot follow the protocol to the end, which will become apparent in the final step when they need to authenticate the data with the session keys. Before authenticating the terminal, the passport does not share any data that enables brute-forcing the password key. Non-participants who do know the password cannot derive the session keys because they do not know the ECDH private keys.Gaps in the threat model: Why you shouldn’t give your passport to just anyoneWhen considering potential solutions to maintaining passports’ confidentiality and authenticity, it’s important to account for what the inspection system  with your passport, and not just the fancy cryptography the passport supports. If an inspection system performs only BAC/PACE and PA, anyone who has seen your passport could make an electronic copy and pretend to be you when interacting with this system. This is true even if your passport supports AA or CA.Another important factor is tracing: the specifications aim to ensure that someone who does not know a passport’s PACE password (MRZ data in most cases) cannot trace that passport’s movements by interacting with it or eavesdropping on communications it has with legitimate terminals. They attempt to achieve this by ensuring that passports always provide random identifiers (e.g., as part of Type A or Type B ISO 14443 contactless communication protocols) and that the contents of publicly accessible files (e.g., those containing information necessary for performing PACE) are the same for every citizen of a particular country.However, all of these protections go out of the window when the attacker knows the password. If you are entering another country and border control scans your passport, they can provide your passport contents to others, enabling them to track the movements of your passport. If you visit a hotel in Italy and they store a scan of your passport and get hacked, anyone with access to this information can track your passport. This method can be a bit onerous, as it requires contacting various nearby contactless communication devices and trying to authenticate to them as if they were your passport. However, some may still choose to include it in their threat models.Some countries state in their issued passports that the holder should give it to someone else only if there is a statutory need. At Italian hotels, for example, it is sufficient to provide a prepared copy of the passport’s photo page with most data redacted (such as your photo, signature, and any personal identification numbers). In practice, not many people do this.Even without the passport, the threat model says nothing about tracking particular groups of people. Countries typically buy large quantities of the same electronic passports, which comprise a combination of an IC and the embedded software implementing the passport specifications. This means that people from the same country likely have the same model of passport, with a unique fingerprint comprising characteristics like communication time, execution time, supported protocols (ISO 14443 Type A vs Type B), etc. Furthermore, each country may use different parameters for PACE (supported curves or mappings, etc.), which may aid an attacker in fingerprinting different types of passports, as these parameters are stored in publicly readable files.Security and privacy implications of zero-knowledge identity proofsAn emerging approach in both academic research and industry applications involves using zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs with identity documents, enabling verification of specific identity attributes without revealing complete document contents. This is a nice idea in theory, because this will allow proper use of passports where there is no statutory need to hand over your passport. However, there are security implications.First of all, passports cannot generate ZK proofs by themselves, so this necessarily involves exposing your passport to a prover. Letting anyone or anything read your passport means that you downgrade your threat model with respect to that entity. So when you provide your passport to an app or website for the purposes of creating a ZK proof, you need to consider what they will do with the information in your passport. Will it be processed locally on your device, or will it be sent to a server? If the data leaves your device, will it be encrypted and only handled inside a trusted execution environment (TEE)? If so, has this whole stack been audited, including against malicious TEE operators?Second, if the ZK proving service relies on PA for its proofs, then anyone who has ever seen your passport can pretend to be you on this service. Full security requires AA or CA. As long as there exists any service that relies only on PA, anyone whose passport data is exposed is vulnerable to impersonation. Even if the ZK proving service does not incorporate AA or CA in their proofs, they should still perform one of these procedures with the passport to ensure that only legitimate passports sign up for this service.Finally, the system needs to consider what happens when people share their ZK proof with others. The nice thing about a passport is that you cannot easily make copies (if AA or CA is used), but if I can allow others to use my ZK proof, then the value of the identification decreases.It is important that such systems are audited for security, both from the point of view of the user and the service provider.

year and wanted to share a few short impressions. As always, I am not a
professional laptop reviewer, so in this article you won’t find benchmarks, just
subjective thoughts!Back in 2021, I wrote about the MacBook Air
M1, which was the first computer I used that
contained Apple’s own ARM-based CPU. Having a silent laptop with long battery
life was a game-changer, so I wanted to keep those properties.When the US government announced tariffs, I figured I would replace my 4-year
old MacBook Air M1 with a more recent model that should last a few more
years. Ultimately, Apple’s prices remained stable, so, in retrospect, I could
have stayed with the M1 for a few more years. Oh well.The nano-textured displayI went to the Apple Store to compare the different options in
person. Specifically, I was curious about the display and whether the increased
weight and form factor of the MacBook Pro (compared to a MacBook Air) would be
acceptable. Another downside of the Pro model is that it comes with a fan, and I
really like absolutely quiet computers. Online, I read from other MacBook Pro
owners that the fan mostly stays off.In general, I would have preferred to go with a MacBook Air because it has
enough compute power for my needs and I like the case better (no ventilation
slots), but unfortunately only the MacBook Pro line has the better displays.Why aren’t all displays nano-textured? The employee at the Apple Store presented
the trade-off as follows: The nano texture display is great at reducing
reflections, at the expense of also making the picture slightly less vibrant.I could immediately see the difference when placing two laptops side by side:
The bright Apple Store lights showed up very prominently on the normal display
(left), and were almost not visible at all on the nano texture display (right):Personally, I did not perceive a big difference in “vibrancy”, so my choice was
clear: I’ll pick the MacBook Pro over the MacBook Air (despite the weight) for
the nano texture display!After using the laptop in a number of situations, I am very happy with this
choice. In normal scenarios, I notice no reflections at all (where my previous
laptop did show reflections!). This includes using the laptop on a train (next
to the window), or using the laptop outside in daylight.(When I chose the new laptop, Apple’s M4 chips were current. By now, they have
released the first devices with M5 chips.)I decided to go with the MacBook Pro with M4 chip instead of the M4  chip
because I don’t need the extra compute, and the M4 needs less cooling — the M4
Pro apparently runs hotter. This increases the chance of the fan staying off.Here are the specs I ended up with:14" Liquid Retina XDR Display with nano textureApple M4 Chip (10 core CPU, 10 core GPU)32 GB RAM (this is the maximum!), 2 TB SSD (enough for this computer)One thing I noticed is that the MacBook Pro M4 sometimes gets warm, even when it
is connected to power, but is suspended to RAM (and has been fully charged for
hours). I’m not sure why.Luckily, the fan indeed stays silent. I think I might have heard it spin up once
in half a year or so?The battery life is amazing! The previous MacBook Air M1 had amazing all-day
battery life already, and this MacBook Pro M4 lasts even longer. For example,
watching videos on a train ride (with VLC) for 3 hours consumed only 10% of
battery life. I generally never even carry the charger.Because of that, Apple’s re-introduction of MagSafe, a magnetic power connector
(so you don’t damage the laptop when you trip over it), is nice-to-have but
doesn’t really make much of a difference anymore. In fact, it might be better to
pack a USB-C cable when traveling, as that makes you more flexible in how you
use the charger.I was curious whether the 120 Hz display would make a difference in practice. I
mostly notice the increased refresh rate when there are animations, but not,
for example, when scrolling.One surprising discovery (but obvious in retrospect) is that even non-animations
can become faster. For example, when running a Go web server on , I
noticed that navigating between pages by clicking links felt faster on the 120
Hz display!The following illustration shows why that is, using a page load that takes 6ms
of processing time. There are three cases (the illustration shows an average
case and the worst case):Best case: Page load finishes  the next frame is displayed: no delay.Worst case: Page load finishes  a frame is displayed: one frame of delay.Most page loads are somewhere in between. We’ll have 0.x to 1.0 frames of delayAs you can see, the waiting time becomes shorter when going from 60 Hz (one
frame every 16.6ms) to 120 Hz (one frame every 8.3ms). So if you’re working with
a system that has <8ms response times, you might observe actions completing (up
to) twice as fast!I don’t notice going back to 60 Hz displays on computers. However, on phones,
where a lot more animations are a key part of the user experience, I think 120
Hz displays are more interesting.My ideal MacBook would probably be a MacBook Air, but with the nano-texture display! :)I still don’t like macOS and would prefer to run Linux on this laptop. But
Asahi Linux still needs some work before it’s usable
for me (I need external display output, and M4 support). This doesn’t bother me
too much, though, as I don’t use this computer for serious work.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AerynOS 2025.10 ISOs Released - GNOME 49, Switches Back To GNU libstdc++</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/AerynOS-2025.10-ISOs</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 10:12:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[AerynOS 2025.10 ISOs were released today for closing out the month of October.

The release introduces Blended Identity, which defines how AI agents act on behalf of verified users, and the MCP Identity Gateway, which ensures secure access to enterprise resources based on identity, access policy, and runtime attributes.The new offering extends the Aembit Workload IAM Platform to address one of the most pressing operational questions in artificial intelligence and modern IT: how to control what autonomous and user-driven AI agents can access, under what conditions, and with what accountability.AI agents are rapidly becoming a key part of enterprise operations. Nearly half of technology executives say they are already adopting or fully deploying agentic AI, and about the same share expect most of their AI deployments to be autonomous within two years, according to an . These agents retrieve sensitive data, open tickets, and execute code across cloud, on-premises, and SaaS environments.Yet most access models were built for people, not self-directed software. Many still rely on static secrets and shared credentials, creating risk and obscuring accountability. Worse yet, agents’ actions are often hidden behind the identity of a human, making it almost impossible to audit the actions each actor has taken. The result is a widening gap between the pace of AI adoption and the ability of organizations to secure it with confidence. assigns each agent a cryptographically verified identity, issues ephemeral credentials, and enforces policy at runtime. The system records every access decision and maintains attribution across both human-driven and autonomous agent activity. By bringing agent activity under the same centralized policy control plane that governs other workloads, Aembit enables enterprises to deploy AI at scale while maintaining control, auditability, and compliance.“Enterprises want to say yes to agentic AI, and they’re asking Aembit for ways to securely grant agents access to data and applications,” said David Goldschlag, co-founder and CEO of Aembit. “Aembit IAM for Agentic AI gives enterprises the same level of control and audit over agent access that IAM systems have long provided for employees. Our approach enables organizations to advance their AI initiatives without expanding their threat and risk surface.”The release introduces two core capabilities to the Aembit Workload IAM Platform:Blended Identity, which gives every AI agent its own verified identity and, when needed, binds it to the human it represents. This establishes a single, traceable identity for each agent action and allows Aembit to issue a secure credential that reflects that combined context.MCP Identity Gateway, which receives that identity credential and controls how agents connect to tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The gateway authenticates the agent, enforces policy, and performs token exchange to securely retrieve the necessary access permissions for each connected resource – without ever exposing them to the agent runtime.Together, this functionality allows enterprises to apply least-privilege access, revoke permissions immediately when needed, and ensure that every AI action is attributable and auditable. They operate on Aembit’s established Workload IAM foundation, which enforces policy dynamically at runtime, issues ephemeral credentials just in time, and records structured events for full traceability.Aembit developed IAM for Agentic AI through collaboration with large businesses, government organizations, and innovative agentic AI startups deploying AI for operational and security workloads. Those efforts helped shape an approach that combines enterprise enforcement with the adaptability AI projects demand.“AI agents don’t live inside one stack or trust domain,” said Kevin Sapp, co-founder and CTO of Aembit. “They move between hybrid environments in seconds. With Aembit, every agent carries a verified identity that our gateway can authenticate and control in real time. It’s how enterprises can give agents the access they need to work, while never losing sight of who they are or what they touch.”Aembit IAM for Agentic AI is now available to customers using its Workload IAM Platform. Organizations can learn more, request a demo, or get started today at . is the identity and access management platform for agentic AI and workloads. It enforces access based on identity, context, and centrally managed policies, giving organizations a singular place to control access risk from AI agents, automate credential management, and accelerate AI adoption. With Aembit, enterprises can confidently control access to sensitive resources across all the workloads that power their business.:::tip

It is a surprisingly hard problem and I want to talk about some of the issues we faced.What about the Open Source that UK Government ?Open Source is facing a crisis. The code that the world relies on is often developed by underpaid engineers on the brink of burn-out.  While I don't think anyone wants Open Source to have a paywall, it seems obvious that large organisation should pay their way and not rely solely on volunteer labour.Here are some of the problems I faced when trying to get the UK Government to pay for OSS and how  as a maintainer can help make it easier for large organisations to pay you.Firstly, lots of OSS doesn't have a well defined owner; so who gets the money?I'm not saying that every little library you create needs to be published by a registered company, nor am I suggesting that you should remove your anonymity. But Governments and other organisations need to know  they are funding and  the money is going. The danger of accidentally funnelling money to a sanctioned state or person is just too big a risk for most organisations.If you want to receive funding - make it  clear who you are.Even when there is an owner, there often isn't an easy mechanism for paying people. Donation sites like GitHub Sponsors, Ko-Fi, and Patreon are great for individuals who want to throw a small amount of money to creators but they can be problematic for larger organisations.  Many OSS projects get around this by offering support contracts. It makes it much easier for an organisation to justify their spend because they're no longer donating to something which can be obtained for free; they're paying for a service.This doesn't have to be a contract offering a 24/7 response and guaranteed SLA. It can be as simple as offering best-effort email support.The important thing is to offer an  way for a larger organisation to buy your services. Many organisations have corporate credit cards for lower-cost discretionary spending which doesn't require a full business-case.  How easily could a manager buy a £500 support contact from your site?Maintainers don't only have to offer support contracts. Many choose to offer training packages which are a good way to raise money  get more people using your product. Some project maintainers will speak at your conference for a suitable fee.Again, the aim here is for maintainers to offer a  reason for a payment to be made.Open Source has a brilliant culture of allowing multiple (often anonymous) contributors. That's fine when there's no money involved, but how does a moderately sized project decide who receives what share of the funding? Services like OpenCollective can make it easier to show  the money is going but it is better to discuss in advance with all contributors what they expect as a share.If people think they're being taken advantage of, or that a project maintainer is unjustly enriching themselves, it can cause arguments.  Be very clear to contributors what the funding is for and whether they're entitled to any of it.Finally, we faced the issue that some OSS projects didn't  to take money from the "big bad state". They were worried that if people saw "Sponsored by the Government" they would assume that there were backdoors for spies, or that the developer might give in to pressure to add unwanted features.  This (usually) isn't the case but it is easy to see why having a single large organisation as the main donor could give the impression of impropriety.The best defence against this is to have  of paying sponsors! Having the state as one of many partners makes it clear that a project isn't beholden to any one customer.It isn't impossible to get Governments to spend on Open Source. But state spending is heavily scrutinised and, bluntly, they aren't set up to pay  amounts to non-suppliers, who aren't charging money.  While large projects often have the resources to apply for Government grants and contracts, smaller projects rarely have the time or expertise. It is critical that maintainers remove the barriers which make it too hard for organisations to pay them.Make it easy for Governments and other large organisations to pay you.Be as obvious as possible that you are able to accept payments from them.Don't be afraid to put a large price on your talents.Offer multiple paid-for options like speaker fees, support, and feature development funding.Talk with your contributors to let them know how any funding will be shared.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Empowering Flink CDC: Schema Evolution Support Lands in Apache SeaTunnel</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/empowering-flink-cdc-schema-evolution-support-lands-in-apache-seatunnel?source=rss</link><author>William Guo</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 07:08:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[From classroom to codebase!

Companies are burning more than $200 billion every year by choosing AI over simple, proven algorithms. That’s not an opinion. That’s math. (See the chart below if you’re still rubbing your eyes in disbelief.)==But here’s the question: Is AI the villain - or are CEOs burning money on systems they barely understand?The truth is more brutal than either narrative. AI isn’t the disaster — it’s the  for the disaster.Look at the chart below. This is your American Horror Story in three acts: Solo AI vendors promise revolutionary decision-making. Fortune 500 CEOs, hypnotized by NVIDIA’s stock price and OpenAI’s demos, write checks their companies can’t cash. That red line? That’s $500 billion annually achieving -45% ROI (Return on Investment — how much you get back compared to what you spend). Not a typo.  forty-five percent. Companies are paying premium prices to make  decisions . It’s like hiring McKinsey to tell you what you already know, except McKinsey occasionally delivers positive value. Nobody admits failure. The AI system becomes “strategic infrastructure.” The losses get buried in “digital transformation.” The vendors — , the whole choir — keep singing about the future while cashing checks in the present.Remember the California Gold Rush from the history books? You know who got rich in 1849. Not the miners. The pickaxe sellers.==Today’s pickaxe merchants sell GPU clusters and API tokens to CEOs panning for digital gold.== They whisper sweet promises: “AI will revolutionize your business.” What they don’t mention is that graph showing AI never achieves positive ROI for operational decisions.Instead they boast about having more billion parameters than the competition’s AI monster. Of course theirs is bigger, more insanely convoluted — an expanding minefield of compounding errors,  each cascade multiplying the disaster.Meanwhile, see that green line in the chart above — simple algorithms from 1913 — keeps printing money at 1200% ROI. But nobody’s selling conferences about the Economic Order Quantity formula. There’s no TED talk about Little’s Law and the other older algorithms.Yep, unfortunately you can’t raise billions in funding rounds by selling an algorithm that fits on a napkin from that expensive restaurant where you’re shaking hands with investors interested in a bigger AI beast.🤔The tragedy is more nuanced than AI sellers admit — and more complex than CEOs with their broken quarterly-profit-maximization algorithms want to hear.Yes, there’s a hybrid approach where AI becomes just one component alongside those ancient algorithms when complexity grows. But that requires two things the AI revolution explicitly avoids:==First, you need to understand your business== ==from the molecular level to the stratosphere — every intricacy of your model, what you’re actually selling versus what you think you’re selling, where costs hide, where value emerges. These insights come from human minds. AI won’t solve what you can’t articulate, despite the sales pitch.====Second, you need to hire and respect professional====s who combine programming excellence with mathematical rigor and the rare ability to translate both into business value. But your AI recruiting system will never surface these people.== It’s optimized for commodities, not talent — screening for keywords, not capability.Look at the carnage in the table below (Chart 3) . This isn’t speculation — it’s documented history: Running on a decision that fits on an index card. Investment: approximately zero. Return: Industry dominance for four decades. The crown jewel of . Investment: $4 billion. Return: Sold for parts at a 95% loss. One simple rule about load factors. Still the only major US airline to avoid bankruptcy. Cutting-edge AI pricing models. Burned $500 million in one quarter before shutting down entirely.The only success story with AI? Amazon’s hybrid approach — yup, not pure AI, it’s old-school EOQ with some ML sprinkled on top when absolutely necessary. Even then, the ROI is a fraction of what simple algorithms achieve alone.But let’s be honest here, let’s not throw the baby out with the bathwater: when your business complexity genuinely grows — meaning the actual number of variables you must account for — you need more flexibility. That might be AI/ML, or more likely, it’s just good programmers who understand your business and can architect the math you actually need.Here’s what 20 years in the trenches taught most of us: around 90% of “complex” business problems can be solved by a competent programmer with decent math skills and simple algorithms, properly wired together.Occam’s Razor still cuts: The simplest solution that works is usually right.==But simplicity doesn’t sell conference tickets. Simplicity doesn’t raise Series B funding. Simplicity doesn’t get you on the cover of Wired. 😂==So instead, companies take the lazy, prestigious route: throw their problems at whatever AI the vendors are pushing this quarter. It’s like hiring a top surgeon to apply a Band-Aid — expensive, unnecessary, and probably going to make things worse.The real tragedy? That competent programmer with the simple solution costs $150K/year. The AI system that fails costs $15M. But the programmer doesn’t come with a sales team, a PowerPoint deck, or a promise to “transform your digital future.”Guess which one the board approves.The Seven Heroes of Business HistoryOur position shouldn’t surprise you by now, dear reader. We’re betting on what’s worked brilliantly for decades through every crisis, disaster, and market shift while delivering massive profits: The formula is simple: Hire, value, and respect your best asset — . Add modern cloud infrastructure and, when genuinely appropriate (maybe 5–10% of cases), deploy the hybrid Algorithm + AI/ML approach.But let’s be clear: forget the magic they’re selling — the fantasy of throwing data at AI and getting perfect solutions every time. That’s not happening.Yes, LLMs are useful as search tools, data navigators, even coding assistants. But they’re far from autonomous. In non-trivial cases, you need spend lot of time cross-referencing to catch their false positives and, worse, the errors nobody notices —  that spaghettify and collide concepts into dangerous nonsense.Meet the Magnificent SevenMore than 500 years of combined service. Trillions in value created. Under 1K lines of code total.Look at this table (Chart 4). These seven algorithms have never failed. For decades — in some cases over a century — they’ve consistently delivered business value to most of mankind. The epitome of simplicity.\
Each one is a specialist with embarrassingly simple code:EOQ (1913): The inventory gunslinger - Square root of (2 × demand × order cost / holding cost). One line. Tells you exactly how much to order.DuPont (1920): The financial sharpshooter - ROE = Profit Margin × Asset Turnover × Leverage. Three numbers multiplied. Instant diagnosis of what’s broken.Newsvendor (1950s): The perishables ranger - Order up to the point where the  matches the cost of running short vs. overstocking. A single threshold for “how much to make.”Kelly (1956): The risk-sizing marshal - Bet a fraction of your bankroll based on  — when your advantage is bigger, size up; when it’s small, size down. Never overbet.CPM (1957): The project management tracker - Find the longest path through your network. That’s your deadline. Everything else can slip; this can’t.Little’s Law (1961): The operations enforcer - Items in system = arrival rate × time in system. It’s physics, not statistics. Works for everything.PageRank (1998): The young gun who built an empire - A page’s importance is the sum of votes from important pages, each vote , with a small  factor to keep it stable. Keep iterating. Built Google.Total code for all seven: comfortably <1K lines. The math that runs the world fits in a single GitHub gist.Is a programming career still viable? Looking at this table — absolutely. Learning algorithms and programming built the past and will build the future, despite this transient AI-hypnotized present.The AI hype has its place — pattern finding, searching, identifying. But it needs years of improvement to correct its statistical errors from Type I through IV. Even then, algorithms in the hands of competent developers remain irreplaceable and far from commodities. While everyone chases AI complexity, these seven simple formulas keep generating thousands of percent returns. They don’t need updates. They don’t hallucinate. They just work.That’s not outdated. That’s immortal. Let’s keep programming with algorithms while the true researchers work on fixing AI errors with better math.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Road to Hell is Paved with Good DRY Intentions</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-good-dry-intentions?source=rss</link><author>Melvin Kosisochukwu</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:53:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I have come across my share of beautifully written, over-engineered code… one moment I am thinking “That is an interesting way to do that” and the next minute you are wondering “what the hell is going on here!”. I have also suffered from writing over-engineered code, where you are thinking so far into the future that you compromise . The  (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) principle is a good way to counter over-engineering: functionalities should only be implemented when you need them, not on the possibility that you will need them. I have mentioned over-engineering a couple of times now, and some of you reading this are probably thinking What is over-engineering?In very simple terms, over-engineering is making software/system design more complex than necessary; this usually happens because you want to add extra functionality to your component to simplify the implementation of A, only to add the functionality for B later.We have this codebase for managing invitations; it’s an inherited, legacy codebase with technical debt that accrues interest. The more you try to work on the legacy code, the more something somewhere else breaks. You have to revert in most cases and start all over. Working around the legacy code ends up accruing interest on the technical debt; it’s a standoff between risking breaking features all over the app or adding more technical debt to the codebase. The third solution we came up with was abstraction. We had to figure out ways to modularise new features or improvements to the application, and to expose and share data where necessary. At first, this seemed like a Hail Mary. Finally, we can work on this mangled codebase with minimal side effects. Were we wrong!! The abstraction spiraled, and the codebase ended up overabstracted, bloating the solution to the problem and bringing the supposed salvaged side of the codebase into its own hell. Along the line, we forgone the rules for the abstraction and now have different parts of the application dependent on each other, looping back to where we started. I suppose this was bound to happen in a codebase with a couple of developers, each with fire up their asses to ship features; we ended up shipping maintenance and more technical debt.When collaborating with multiple people on a codebase (which is pretty much always the case), and for corporates who are more interested in shipping features than code quality, code reviews always suffer. For problems like over-engineering and overabstraction, Traditional line-by-line code reviews often miss these systematic issues. You check a component created a couple of weeks ago to support the integration of a feature, following the DRY principle, and realize there are now 10 interconnected/similar features that depend on the component. Code reviews will need to be elevated to catch these architectural issues and ensure that dependency requirements between components are met.We live by the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) gospel because it simplifies work, and developers are inherently lazy (in a good way). The DRY principle works well with orthogonal systems: small, self-contained components combined to form a system.Systems should be composed of a set of cooperating modules, each of which implements functionality independent of each other.There should be more emphasis on orthogonal systems and on DRY code; it’s easier to combine the reusable functions you create with each other and scale them as the repository progresses when they are not bloated and overabstracted, at which point you end up with a rigid system interwoven so much with each other that it will be complicated to connect which aspects of the code that does not meet an exact rule, you will find yourself duplicating the code because making it work for a new connection breaks an old system. Congratulations, you have achieved Spaghetti code that cannot bend. To use a truly orthogonal system and avoid spaghetti DRY code, every code module change should affect only the module that is updated.Your components should not focus solely on avoiding repetition, but also on being small abstractions of the overall system; otherwise, you will end up with components so complex that they can easily break with a single change to a connected component. When creating reusable code, the approach should be writing code that does not depend on any other code block to function a certain way. Reusability should be used as a tool and not the goal; when you have reusable UI components with business or API logic in the same component, you are on a highway to over-abstraction. It starts small, and before you realize what is happening, the disease has festered throughout your repository. Now you cannot reuse the component on a different page with the same UI functions and different logic without adding additional external logic/context to the component.Modularity Modularity ModularityModularity involves breaking your system down into smaller, independent codes/components called modules. Please pay attention to the word ‘smaller’; it’s possible to have a bloated module with more code than necessary, which creates over-abstraction and should be avoided. Over-abstraction is really just an unsuccessful attempt at modularity. Your modules should be able to function independently of other modules, only exposing required data. Changes to good, modular, structured code should affect only the modules, without any cascading effects.A good approach to building orthogonal systems and easily avoiding over-abstraction is to build with functionality first, then features; this aligns well with Component-Based architecture(separating UI components from stateful components). The functionality stage will focus on the smallest reusable units of code that are assembled to implement the feature. A Login feature will consist of the following functions: collect username and password (UI), validate user data, redirect to the user profile/reject collected user data. Each functionality should operate independently, relying only on necessary data.No medals for over-sophisticated codeAfter writing every code implementation, ask yourself whether there is an easier or simpler way to achieve the same result. Most of us have heard stories about code that can be edited or worked on by only one person in the company, which is not a feat to be proud of. Writing code that can only be maintained by you most likely means it’s over-sophisticated or employs unorthodox procedures. A great example of coding using unorthodox procedures is Gilfoyle’s Hard Drives from the article:  I have found myself writing overly sophisticated code because I want to use a new technology/package/library I just learned about, without considering whether it is the simplest tool for the job. The excitement for learning something new is great, but attention to when and where it should be applied is probably more important.In the quest for writing perfect codes that account for all possible future and time-travelling cases, you end up with an over-engineered codebase. You should give it up because it is not possible to write perfect code, aim for good enough that meets all your immediate requirements. The DRY principle is fundamental; repetition is still a sin in software development. The DRY principle should be applied to an orthogonal system to create a codebase that is decoupled, with each module independent and exchanging data at a separate meeting point(feature module). These will help you create systems that are easy to maintain and debug. Remember that simple is always better in software development.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 9 Best Affiliate Recruitment Tools to Scale Your Affiliate Program</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/the-9-best-affiliate-recruitment-tools-to-scale-your-affiliate-program?source=rss</link><author>Endorsely</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 06:18:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ever since I started managing affiliate programs, I've been obsessed with finding ways to make partner discovery more efficient. The traditional approach - listing your program on directories and hoping quality affiliates stumble across it - is painfully slow. You're competing with hundreds of other programs for attention from affiliates who are already making good money promoting your competitors.Here's what actually works: finding people who are already successfully creating content about products like yours, and reaching out to them directly. It's not rocket science, but it's incredibly time-consuming if you're doing it manually.  because it shows you who is promoting your competitors on their website or social media.It’s not limited to one particular network or database, and it runs weekly scans to pick up on the freshest opportunities to promote your product or brand.But the right tool for you will depend on your budget, your ICP, and the stage you’re at with your affiliate program. In this guide, I'll break down the 9 best options, explain exactly what makes each one valuable, and help you figure out which tool (or combination of tools) will actually grow your program without wasting your time or budget.|  |  |  |  |
|----|----|----|----|
|  | Custom, AI-powered affiliate discovery | AI web scraping + weekly scans | $99/month with 7-day free trial |
|  | Running a SaaS affiliate program | Built-in affiliate discovery | Free until $1K revenue (then $39/month) |
|  | Traditional publishers | Network integration | $456/month |
|  | Marketplace access | 3M+ affiliate network | $39/month + fees |
|  | Influencer recruitment | 100M+ creator database | $299/month |
|  | Multi-channel campaigns | E-commerce integration | Custom (est. $500+/month) |
|  | Enterprise influencer programs | AI automation (Gia) | Custom (est. $1,000+/month) |
|  | Influencer discovery across 30+ platforms | 40+ filter options | $199/month |
|  | Partnership intelligence | Free B2B directory | Free | is the best affiliate discovery tool for SaaS and e-commerce brands because it finds potential partners who are already talking about products just like yours.Whereas many other tools rely solely on their own directory or marketplace, AffiliateFinder.ai scans the whole internet to find the best-match affiliates for your brand. \n I tested this with a client in the keyword research tool space. Within 15 minutes of setting it up, AffiliateFinder.ai found 1300+ potential affiliates - bloggers ranking for "Ahrefs alternatives," YouTubers reviewing competitor products, and websites comparing tools in the space. More importantly, these weren't just names in a database from 2019. These were people who had published content in the last few weeks, so I got a much higher response rate than I had with other tools, and recruited more new partners.The platform works by continuously scanning the web, YouTube, and Instagram for anyone mentioning your competitors or ranking for your target keywords. It uses AI to filter out irrelevant results (like Wikipedia pages or your actual competitors) and delivers a curated list of partnership opportunities.You can view all the stats you need to help make a decision (subscribers, views, engagement rate) without having to leave your dashboard.This list gets updated every week, with an email notifying you of the top results, so now I have over 3,000 opportunities for this client.AffiliateFinder.ai’s filters make it easy to sort through your results and prioritize outreach according to your campaign goals.For example, if you want to work with nano-influencers with small but engaged audiences, you can filter results to show those with less than 10k subscribers.As you go through the results, you can add them to different lists according to how relevant they are. From your ‘saved’ list, you can check contact details - this finds email addresses and social media profiles associated with the domain or channel.The YouTube email finder deserves special mention because it solves one of the most annoying problems in affiliate recruitment. Normally, getting a YouTuber's email means breaking CAPTCHAs manually, which YouTube actively limits.It even finds Linkedin and Twitter (X) profiles for some affiliates, so you can DM them directly if they’re more active on social media than email. AffiliateFinder.ai finds these emails in seconds, turning what would be hours of tedious work into a single click. I've personally used this to reach out to 83 YouTube creators in a single afternoon - something that would have taken me several days (and multiple YouTube accounts) to do manually.The platform supports 195+ countries and 40+ languages, which matters more than you might think. If you're expanding internationally, you can set up separate scans for each geo and find Australian travel influencers, French beauty creators, or Swedish sneaker reviewers - whatever you need to get more eyes on your product. Growing SaaS companies, agencies managing multiple clients, e-commerce brands in competitive niches, and anyone who’s had enough of outdated affiliate databases.Finds 500-750+ relevant affiliates instantlyWeekly automated scans catch new opportunitiesFinds emails for websites, YouTube channels, and Instagram pagesCompetitor-based discovery (proven performers)Multi-geo and multi-language supportNo built-in affiliate tracking or paymentsRequires a separate outreach tool for campaignsResults still need a manual sense-check Includes unlimited discovery, 150 email credits monthly, 1 brand analysis, 2 users 500 email credits, 5 brands, 5 users  Custom pricing and packages (API, custom webhooks) If you're serious about scaling your affiliate program and have the budget for a professional tool, AffiliateFinder.ai should be your first purchase after affiliate tracking software. The competitive intelligence approach fundamentally changes how you recruit - from hoping affiliates find you to actively poaching your competitors' best partners.2. Endorsely: Best Budget Option for SaaS combines affiliate recruitment with full program management, wrapping it all in a pricing model that's genuinely friendly to early-stage companies: it's free until your affiliate program generates $1,000 in monthly revenue. \n  Think about that for a second. You can discover affiliates, track their performance, manage payouts, and grow your program to $12K annual revenue before spending a single dollar on the platform. Then it's just $39/month until you hit $5,000 monthly, and $99/month after that. Compare this to Impact or PartnerStack charging hundreds (or thousands) per month from day one, plus transaction fees on top.Endorsely is specifically designed to manage SaaS affiliate programs, meaning it handles subscriptions, upgrades, and recurring commissions seamlessly.And the great thing is that it has AI-powered affiliate discovery built in, along with email enrichment.Endorsely only covers websites and YouTube channels, so it’s not quite as comprehensive as AffiliateFinder.ai. It also lacks some features like lists and labels.But overall, it’s fantastic value for money - and incredibly well designed - for anyone running a SaaS affiliate program. SaaS companies launching their first affiliate program, bootstrapped startups watching every dollar, and anyone who wants discovery plus management without the enterprise price tag.Completely free until $1K monthly revenueFull program management includedTracks recurring subscription revenue properlyLTV analytics for customer quality insightsSimple, predictable pricing structureDiscovery less comprehensive than dedicated toolsFewer features than enterprise platformsWeekly scans not includedNot designed for e-commerce or service businesses Until $1,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 15 affiliates Up to $5,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 100 affiliates/month Up to $20,000/month in affiliate revenue. Find 250 affiliates/month If you're launching an affiliate program for a SaaS product and need both discovery and tracking,  gives you everything in one package at a price point that won't make your CFO wince. Use it to get your first 50 affiliates, then consider adding AffiliateFinder.ai when you're ready to scale aggressively.3. Publisher Discovery: Best for Traditional Affiliate SitesPublisher Discovery is the tool for brands that want deep data on traditional affiliate websites - the established review sites, comparison blogs, and publisher networks that have been in the game for years.The platform integrates directly with major affiliate networks like ShareASale, CJ, and Impact, which gives it access to performance data that standalone tools can't match. You can search by vertical or network, but there’s no custom discovery based on your brand.Publisher Discovery allows you to filter publishers by SEO metrics (domain authority, traffic volume), see which networks they're active on, and even track their performance once you recruit them. This network integration is huge if you're already running programs on these platforms and want to expand beyond your current affiliate pool.Detailed reporting includes competitor gap analysis and publisher performance benchmarking, which is helpful for identifying your top performers and helping those who are underperforming.Who it's for: Enterprise brands working with affiliate networks, programs targeting established publishers rather than influencers, and teams that need performance data integration.Deep integration with major networksRich SEO and performance dataQuality-focused filteringPerformance tracking post-recruitmentPremium solution ($450+ per month)Limited to affiliates registered on networksSteeper learning curve than simpler tools All features for one campaign (single geo) Five campaigns Unlimited campaigns combines affiliate program management with a built-in marketplace of 3 million affiliates, giving you instant access to thousands of active partners looking for new programs to promote.The marketplace is the real draw here - over 5,000 affiliates actively browse for opportunities, and you can filter them by platform, niche, keywords, and performance metrics.Instead of cold outreach, you're connecting with people who are actively seeking partnerships. I've seen programs get 20-30 quality applications within the first week of listing.However, once you have exhausted the pool of affiliates listed on Refersion for your vertical, new ones don’t come along too often. A tool like AffiliateFinder.ai is better if you want to keep proactively discovering new opportunities every week.Beyond discovery, Refersion handles the full program lifecycle: tracking, commission payments, tax forms (W-9s and 1099s), and automated communications. The first-party cookie tracking is solid, and the platform integrates with major e-commerce platforms, making setup relatively painless.Who it's for: E-commerce brands, D2C companies, and businesses that want a ready-made network plus management tools in one package.3M+ affiliate network with 5,000+ active partnersFull program management includedAutomated commission processing and tax handlingGood filtering for marketplace affiliatesTransaction fees (up to 3%) on top of monthly costMarketplace means competing with other brands for attentionLimited pool of affiliates that doesn’t refresh quicklyLaunch ($39/month + 3% of affiliate sales): Core features, unlimited affiliatesGrowth ($129/month + 2% of affiliate sales): Advanced tracking, email attribution, private offersScale ($599/month + 1% of affiliate sales): Advanced commission options, multi-store support5. Modash: Best for Influencer-Heavy StrategiesModash indexes every social media profile with at least 1,000 followers on Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube - that means hundreds of millions of creators searchable through one interface.The filtering is impressively robust: follower range, location, engagement rate, audience demographics, growth trends, and even fake follower detection. I used it to find 50 Instagram food influencers with 5K-50K followers and minimum 3% engagement in under five minutes. It even has an AI Search option so you can find recent posts of men tying their shoelaces or kids playing with toy cars.One final touch is the influential follower check: you may have influential people following your brand already, and Modash finds them for you.The platform includes email campaigns, tracking, and payment processing so you can manage everything in one place.Who it's for: D2C brands prioritizing influencer partnerships, consumer product companies, and anyone focusing on social media affiliates over traditional publishers.Massive database (every profile with 1K+ followers)Powerful filtering with 40+ criteriaFast, intuitive interfaceExpensive compared to some other toolsInfluencer-focused (less useful for B2B or traditional affiliates)Requires separate tracking software 2 team members, 300 profiles, 150 emailsPerformance ($599/month): 5 team members, 800 profiles, 400 emails, broader content discoveryEnterprise (custom pricing): Higher limits, more seats, paymentsUpfluence offers influencer discovery across all major social networks plus unique features like scanning your customer database to identify which customers are influencers.The platform provides 20+ advanced filters to search its large creator database, with detailed metrics including audience demographics, engagement rates, and estimated sponsored post pricing. \n The e-commerce integration lets you connect your Shopify or WooCommerce store, and Upfluence can identify existing customers with significant social followings, turning them into brand ambassadors. This is a feature I haven’t seen anywhere else, and it’s very valuable for established brands.The affiliate tracking module lets you generate unique codes and referral links for each influencer, tracking sales back to specific creators. Combined with content management, product seeding automation, and campaign analytics, you get a true all-in-one platform.Who it's for: Large brands with significant influencer budgets, agencies managing diverse clients, companies running complex multi-channel campaigns.Comprehensive multi-platform coverageCustomer-to-affiliate conversion featureRich audience data and authenticity metricsFull campaign management includedComplex platform with learning curveOverkill for pure affiliate recruitment needsCustom pricing, generally starting around $500/month with annual contracts, can exceed $1,000/month.7. GRIN: Best for Enterprise Influencer ProgramsGRIN is an enterprise-grade creator management platform with affiliate capabilities, designed for brands managing hundreds of influencer relationships simultaneously with AI-powered automation.The platform's AI assistant "Gia" suggests optimal creators, predicts performance, and automates routine tasks like follow-ups and content tracking. You get complete lifecycle management: discovery, product seeding, content approvals, affiliate link tracking, and payment processing - all in one system. The relationship CRM tracks every conversation, content piece, and product shipment per creator.The affiliate module generates unique codes and links for each influencer, tracking sales and automatically calculating commissions. For brands running hybrid influencer-affiliate programs at scale, GRIN removes the operational chaos and tracks everything in one manageable place.The only downside is that GRIN is focused on social media creators, so you’ll need to pair it with another platform if you want to partner with bloggers too.Who it's for: Large D2C brands, major e-commerce companies, agencies with significant influencer budgets (think 100+ active partnerships).AI automation (Gia) for optimization and suggestionsComplete creator lifecycle managementProduct seeding and content managementRobust analytics and reportingOne of the most expensive options ($1,000-$2,500+/month)Annual contracts requiredOverkill for smaller programsCustom pricing starts at around $1,000 per month.Influencers Club gives you searchable access to 200M+ influencer profiles across more than 30 platforms, including Spotify and Udemy. This broad range of coverage means you can often find creators who don’t show up on bigger platforms like Instagram and YouTube.The 40+ advanced filters let you narrow by platform, follower count, location, engagement rate, posting frequency, and even specific bio keywords.Each creator listed already has a verified email, which is good for easy outreach but may exclude some great opportunities without an email on record.On the API plan, you’re able to use Influencers Club data to enrich your own list of emails or usernames. There’s also the option for a fully managed plan where their team takes care of the outreach for you.Who it's for: Influencer-focused brands running targeted campaigns across multiple platformsInfluencer-heavy (less for traditional publishers)No website/blogger discoveryLimited to creators with emailsDashboard (from $199/month): Discovery and outreach for 200M+ creators with emailsAPI + Dashboard (from $249/month): Includes API access, bulk data, enrichment Fully managed outreach servicePartnerbase is a free public directory of 147,000+ companies and 456,000+ B2B partnerships, making it a valuable research tool for identifying potential affiliate relationships.While not specifically an affiliate recruitment platform, Partnerbase helps you understand the partnership landscape in your industry. You can see which companies have affiliate programs, research competitors' partner ecosystems, and identify businesses that might be good affiliate partners based on their existing relationships.The real value is in research and intelligence rather than direct recruitment. Use it to identify companies worth approaching, understand what partner programs exist in adjacent spaces, and find opportunities for strategic affiliate partnerships beyond typical content creators.Who it's for: B2B companies on tight budgets, researchers mapping partnership landscapes, anyone needing free competitive intelligence.Completely free with registration456,000+ partnerships indexedHelps identify affiliate program opportunitiesRequires manual follow-up workLimited compared to paid tools Complete access with registrationPicking the right recruitment tool isn't about finding the "best" option - it's about matching your specific situation to the right solution. Here's how to think through the decision.Let's do the math that actually matters. If you're an affiliate manager making $60K annually ($30/hour), and manual recruitment takes 20 hours weekly, that's $600/week or $2,400/month of your time. A tool like  at $99/month that saves 75% of that time creates $1,800/month in value - an 18x return.Even tools that seem expensive like GRIN at $1,500/month can justify themselves if you're managing 100+ influencer relationships. That's $15 per relationship monthly for complete automation. Without it, you'd need to hire another full-time person. like Partnerbase and Endorsely's free tier make sense when you're validating whether an affiliate channel works for your business. But once you have proof of concept, the time savings from paid tools become obvious.Launching (0-10 affiliates): Start with manual research and outreach within your network. Focus on proving the channel works before investing heavily in discovery tools.Early Growth (10-50 affiliates): Add AffiliateFinder.ai Pro at $99/month. The competitor intelligence approach helps you reach quality at this stage when every partnership matters.Scaling (50-200 affiliates): Upgrade to AffiliateFinder.ai Agency or add specialized tools like Modash for influencers. Consider Refersion if marketplace access speeds up recruitment.Enterprise (200+ affiliates): GRIN, Upfluence, or other enterprise platforms start making sense. You need sophisticated management alongside discovery. You may want to keep AffiliateFinder.ai to make sure you never run out of new opportunities.The type of affiliate you want to target makes a difference to the tool you choose. Here’s what I recommend:Traditional publishers and bloggers: AffiliateFinder.ai, Publisher Discovery, or Endorsely. These tools excel at finding web content creators.Instagram/TikTok influencers: Modash, Influencers Club, or Upfluence. You need social-first databases with engagement metrics. AffiliateFinder.ai (for the email finder specifically) or Modash. Breaking CAPTCHAs manually will kill your productivity. Publisher Discovery, Partnerbase for research, or AffiliateFinder.ai for finding B2B content creators.Most successful programs need multiple types, which is why many teams run 2-3 tools. For example: AffiliateFinder.ai for bloggers + Modash for influencers, or Refersion marketplace for passive recruitment + AffiliateFinder.ai for active outreach.Discovery vs Management: Why You Need BothAffiliate discovery tools and management platforms solve different problems.While many affiliate management platforms include some type of discovery, it’s typically limited to partners already registered on their platform.A management platform is necessary from day 1 to track affiliate performance and process commissions, but a specialized discovery tool like AffiliateFinder.ai is essential if you want to expand beyond pre-defined marketplaces.When I started out in affiliate management, most of these tools didn’t exist. The options were basically to post in directories and hope for the best, turn manual research into a full-time job, or hire an agency. Today, AI-powered tools give even solo founders the ability to execute sophisticated competitive intelligence strategies that used to require entire teams. wins for most teams because it solves the actual hard problem: finding high-quality affiliates who are already proven performers in your niche.The weekly updates mean you're continuously discovering new opportunities without manual work, and the competitive intelligence angle gives you an unfair advantage over companies still relying on passive recruitment.But the most successful affiliate programs I've seen run a hybrid approach: AffiliateFinder.ai for proactive outreach to competitors' affiliates, a marketplace like Refersion for passive inbound applications, and maybe Upfluence or Modash for more reach into social platforms.When budget is the constraint, Endorsely's free tier gets you started with both discovery and management for literally zero dollars until you hit $1k monthly revenue. That's enough to prove the channel works before investing more heavily.When you need enterprise-scale influencer management and have the budget, GRIN or Upfluence deliver sophisticated automation that justifies their premium pricing. But honestly, most teams should start smaller and scale into these tools rather than buying them upfront.Your competitors are already using these tools. The question isn't whether to invest in affiliate recruitment technology - it's whether you can afford not to. The gap between companies actively recruiting proven affiliates and those hoping affiliates find them is growing wider every month, and the tools that create that gap are all listed above.Affiliate recruitment tools like AffiliateFinder.ai actively find affiliates by scanning the web for competitors' partners, while networks like ShareASale are marketplaces where you list programs and wait for affiliates to apply.Yes, most recruitment tools focus only on discovery and contact finding, so you'll need tracking software like Endorsely, Impact, or Tapfiliate to manage commissions and performance tracking.AffiliateFinder.ai typically saves 15-20 hours weekly by automating competitor research and contact finding that would take days of manual work to accomplish with the same quality.Options exist for every budget: Endorsely starts completely free, AffiliateFinder.ai costs $99 monthly, while enterprise tools like GRIN run $1,000+ monthly depending on program scale and needs.Most successful programs use one primary discovery tool like AffiliateFinder.ai plus free supplementary tools like Partnerbase for additional intelligence and marketplaces like Refersion for passive recruitment.Track time-to-recruit, affiliate quality (measured by conversion rates), and program growth velocity. Successful tools should cut recruitment time by 50%+ while improving partner quality significantly.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Scenes from TechCrunch Disrupt 2025</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/30/scenes-from-techcrunch-disrupt/</link><author>Connie Loizos</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 04:02:33 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to everyone who made this year's San Francisco event what it was -- and to the 10,000 of you who filled the halls, made the connections, and left with more than you came with.

Built with a BGA-1074 package measuring 32 mm × 27 mm, the processor fits within standard mobile SoC dimensions, making it suitable for thin and light computing platforms. It employs a 0.8 mm pitch and FF5 interface, replacing the FF3 socket previously used in Valve’s Steam handheld devices, further hinting at a new generation of compact AMD-powered hardware.

Additionally, the APU carries AMD’s fourth-generation AI engine, enabling on-device inference tasks and enhanced efficiency for workloads such as speech recognition, image analysis, and real-time translation.While AMD experimented with ARM over a decade ago through the abandoned “Project Skybridge,” this new effort represents a more mature and strategic approach. With industry interest in efficient, ARM-based computing accelerating, “Sound Wave” could help AMD diversify its portfolio while leveraging its strengths in graphics and AI acceleration. If reports are accurate, the processor will enter production in late 2025, with commercial devices expected the following year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>John Carmack on mutable variables</title><link>https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/1983593511703474196</link><author>azhenley</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 02:34:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ground stop at JFK due to staffing</title><link>https://www.fly.faa.gov/adv/adv_otherdis?advn=13&amp;adv_date=10312025&amp;facId=JFK&amp;title=ATCSCC%20ADVZY%20013%20JFK/ZNY%2010/31/2025%20CDM%20GROUND%20STOP&amp;titleDate=10/31/2025</link><author>akersten</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 01:48:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ICE and the Smartphone Panopticon</title><link>https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/ice-and-the-smartphone-panopticon</link><author>fortran77</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 01:13:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, as  raids ramped up in New York, city residents set about resisting in the ways they had available: confronting agents directly on sidewalks, haranguing them as they processed down blocks, and recording them on phone cameras held aloft. Relentless documentation has proved something of an effective tool against President Donald Trump’s empowerment of ; agents have taken to wearing masks in fear of exposure, and the proliferation of imagery showing armed police and mobilized National Guard troops in otherwise calm cities has underlined the cruel absurdity of their activities. Activist memes have been minted on social media: a woman on New York’s Canal Street, dressed in a polka-dotted office-casual dress, flipping  agents off; a man in Washington, D.C., throwing a Subway sandwich at a federal agent in August. The recent “No Kings” marches were filled with protesters in inflatable frog costumes, inspired by a similarly outfitted man who got pepper-sprayed protesting outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Building in Portland, Oregon. Some might write the memes off as resistance porn, but digital content is at least serving as a lively defense mechanism in the absence of functional politics.At the same time, social media has served as a reinvigorated source of transparency in recent weeks, harking back to the days when Twitter became an organizing tool during the Arab Spring, in the early twenty-tens, or when Facebook and Instagram helped fuel the Black Lives Matter marches of 2020. The grassroots optimism of that earlier social-media era is long gone, though, replaced by a sense of posting as a last resort. After Trump authorized the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago earlier this month, the governor of Illinois, J. B. Pritzker, told residents to “record and narrate what you see—put it on social media.” But, if the anti- opposition is taking advantage of the internet,  and the Trump Administration are, too. Right-wing creators have been using the same channels to identify and publicize targets for raids. According to reporting in Semafor, the Trump-friendly YouTuber Nick Shirley’s videos of African migrant vendors on Canal Street seemed to help drive recent  sweeps of the area.  itself is also working to monitor social media. The investigative outlet  found documents revealing that the agency has enlisted an A.I.-driven surveillance product called Zignal Labs that creates “curated detection feeds” to aid in criminal investigations. According to reporting in ,  also has plans to build out a team of dozens of analysts to monitor social media and identify targets. Recent videos, identified by 404 Media and other publications, have purportedly shown  agents using technology developed by the data-analytics firm Palantir, founded by Peter Thiel and others, to scan social-media accounts, government records, and biometrics data of those they detain. Social media has become a political panopticon in which your posts are a conduit for your politics, and what you post can increasingly be used against you.Meanwhile, a new wave of digital tools has emerged to help surveil the surveillants. The apps ICEBlock, Red Dot, and DEICER all allow users to pinpoint where  agents are active, forming an online version of a whisper network to alert potential targets. Eyes Up provides a way for users to record and upload footage of abusive law-enforcement activity, building an archive of potential evidence. Its creator is a software developer named Mark (who uses only his first name to separate the project from his professional work); he was inspired to create Eyes Up earlier this year, when he began seeing clips of  abductions and harassment circulating on social media and worried about their shelf life. As he put it to me, “They could disappear at any given moment, whether the platforms decide to moderate, whether the individual deletes their account or the post.”Ultimately, the app itself was also vulnerable to sudden disappearance. After launching, on September 1st, Eyes Up accumulated thousands of downloads and thousands of minutes of uploaded footage. Then, on October 3rd, Mark received a notice that Apple was removing the app from its store on the grounds that it may “harm a targeted individual or group.” Eyes Up is not alone. ICEBlock and Red Dot have been blocked from both Apple and Google’s app stores, the two largest marketplaces; DEICER, like Eyes Up, was removed by Apple. Pressure on the tech platforms seemed to come from the Trump Administration; after a deadly shooting at an  field office in Dallas in late September, the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that ICEBlock “put ICE agents at risk just for doing their jobs.” Mark is contesting Apple’s decision about Eyes Up through its official channels, and the creator of ICEBlock, Joshua Aaron, has argued that his app should be treated no differently than services, such as Google’s Waze, that allow users to warn one another of highway speed traps. But for now they must try to make do with a limited reach.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Myths Programmers Believe about CPU Caches (2018)</title><link>https://software.rajivprab.com/2018/04/29/myths-programmers-believe-about-cpu-caches/</link><author>whack</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:46:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[distributed-system-architecturedatabase-isolation-levelsstrong-vs-eventual consistencyvolatilesread/written all the way to main memoryeven single-core systems are at risk of concurrency bugsgreat wealth of nuancethis tutorialMESI protocolThe state of the cache-line is set to M, since it is now modifiedmulti-processor systemimmediately trigger cache reads/writes instead]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Quibbler – A critic for your coding agent that learns what you want</title><link>https://github.com/fulcrumresearch/quibbler</link><author>etherio</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:43:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ancient Irish Funeral Traditions</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/ancient-irish-funeral-traditions</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/6901f0801c14e95bd2a32c34/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=nGqd762jCobROBdgmhw--3en6zjUAHoEscGDzLtWmS8" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 31 Oct 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever been to an Irish wake?

Wise is a financial service that lets you send and receive money across currencies, often at a better rate and lower fee than traditional banks. Sounds great, right?This is our story – a sobering, frustrating, and frankly  experience that ended with our business and personal accounts being shut down, without any meaningful reason, support, or recourse.And all we did? We .🏢 A Routine Change Turned NightmareLike many businesses, we recently moved into a new office. Alongside the usual updates to suppliers and records, we updated our  with Wise. Not long after, we received an email requesting us to  the new address.Fair enough – we had no problem with that.Wise provided a dropdown list of acceptable documents: a lease agreement, rates notice, tax document, utilities bill, or telecommunications bill. Due to our company structure, most of those documents are in the name of our parent company or show our PO Box (which NZ Post requires, since they won’t deliver to our street address). But we had a  that ticked every box:Correct physical street address ✅Even detailed our fibre connection at the new premises ✅So we uploaded it – and assumed that would be the end of it.📞 The Call That Made No SenseDays later, we received an email: our document was . No clear reason. So, I called Wise and explained the situation to the customer service representative.Her response left me stunned.“The document was rejected because it was a , not a .”I paused, trying to process this. I politely explained that in New Zealand, a “tax invoice” is a legal form of a bill – even down to the name “tax invoice” being a legal requirement by IRD, and that’s how telecommunications companies issue invoices here. But she refused to accept it.“It needs to say  at the top,” she insisted.“A tax invoice isn’t acceptable.”This is simply , and completely out of touch with New Zealand’s business documentation standards. The rep wouldn’t budge.🧠 The “Solution” That Was Beyond BeliefStill trying to find a solution, I asked: what do you recommend I do then?“You should find a local shared workspace, lease a desk under your company name, change your registered office to that address, and use that lease document to verify your address with us.”Yes, you read that right.Wise’s advice was to artificially lease a desk we didn’t need, change our registered address, and use that document – just to verify an address we actually operate from.I asked to speak to a manager. That request was . She told me, flatly:“I  providing you with the correct information.”A bit more back and forth… then the call .📞 A Glimmer of Hope – Then The Hammer FallsLater that day, I received a call back from Wise – not from a manager (because apparently, Wise doesn’t have managers), but from a more “senior” representative.This rep was  and agreed the document should have been acceptable. She escalated the issue, resubmitted the document herself, and said she’d personally follow up if it was rejected again.🚫 “We’ve Restricted Your Account”I woke to an email with a stunning subject line:“We’ve restricted your account”Just like that, our  was locked. No warning. No reason. No discussion.We could no longer send or receive money, use our Wise cards, or even contact support. The email stated:“Due to our current risk policies, your account will be closed in a few months. You will not be able to use support channels.”Even worse? My  was locked too. The same personal account which did have its address fully verified, by a rates invoice for my personal address.🧾 An “Appeal” That Wasn’t an AppealThe email offered an option to . Naturally, I did.The appeal process asked for our articles of incorporation and . No problem.Then it asked us to provide our preferred currency, and bank account details to refund the balances.Wait… I thought this was an appeal? A chance to discuss and resolve the issue?That was the end. There was no opportunity to explain anything, no communication, no questions asked. The decision was made, and we were , permanently.To summarise the absurdity of this:We moved office, and updated our address with WiseWe provided a legal, NZ-compliant  showing our entity and addressIt was rejected because it was labelled a “Tax Invoice”A rep told us to lease a coworking desk elsewhere just to get a different documentA senior rep agreed we were right, and escalated itThen our accounts were shut down – with no explanation or recourseEven trying to call support now gets an automated message: “Because your account is restricted, we cannot connect you.”⚠️ Our Final Word: Be Very, Very CarefulWe had used Wise for . Regular monthly supplier payments. International stock orders. Five-figure transactions. Never a problem – until this. A minor change triggered a totally flawed process that , with no transparency or logical path to resolution.We’re not alone – a quick search shows many others facing similar horror stories with Wise.So this is my word of warning:💡 Don’t put all your eggs in the Wise basket.If you’re a business, don’t rely on them as your sole means of transferring funds. For us, it’s back to traditional banks – slower, yes, but at least they have humans you can talk to, and actual escalation paths.🧾 28th October update on our Wise debacle – it gets worse.Following the so-called “appeal” (which gave us no option to provide any information), we received the unsurprising outcome: Wise has decided to  as we had breached their acceptable use policy. 🤨What was surprising, however, was the  they gave after I queried what was breached in Wise’s Acceptable Use Policy:I was told my  was being closed for allegedly breaching their Acceptable Use Policy — specifically, section 1.4.e, which states “you may not use your personal Wise account to receive business payments.”I’ve  used my personal account for business transactions — in fact, over 99% of transfers were to overseas family members. When I asked for clarification or examples, I got none. Just a vague statement and the very strange line:“Just because we can’t offer you our services going forward doesn’t mean that we think your business activities are illegal or illegitimate — it just means that we don’t support those types of activities.”What activities?! Again, To make matters worse — our business account’s refund transfer . Why? Because it requires documentation — the  Wise previously rejected for address verification, claiming a telecommunications tax invoice isn’t a bill.After a few days, the transfer was then cancelled as of course, Wise was unable to “verify” us.So now our , their support ticket is marked “final response,” and our attempts to get clarity have gone nowhere. We’ve escalated the issue to Financial Services Complaints Ltd, Wise’s dispute resolution provider in New Zealand.Funds stuck. No clear reason. No accountability. Wise still gets a 0/10 from us.This isn’t just poor service — it’s unacceptable.Think twice before trusting Wise with your money.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Andrew on the Scariest Interview he’s Ever Done</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/edJnBynQikA</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/edJnBynQikA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:09:04 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Martians: The European Geniuses At The Heart Of The Manhattan Project</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Las2tSe5q4g</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Las2tSe5q4g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 22:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the incredible true story of The Martians, a group of Hungarian-Jewish geniuses who fled European anti-Semitism and Nazi terror to the United States, where their work would change the course of 20th-century history.

Earlier in its European Council presidency, Denmark had brought back a draft law which would have required the scanning, sparking an intense backlash. Known as Chat Control, the measure was intended to crack down on the trafficking of child sex abuse materials (CSAM).  After days of silence, the German government on October 8 announced it would not support the proposal, tanking the Danish effort.  Danish Justice Minister Peter Hummelgaard told reporters on Thursday that his office will support voluntary CSAM detections.  "This will mean that the search warrant will not be part of the EU presidency's new compromise proposal, and that it will continue to be voluntary for the tech giants to search for child sexual abuse material," Hummelgaard said, according to local news reports.  The current model allowing for voluntary scanning expires in April, Hummelgaard said.  "Right now we are in a situation where we risk completely losing a central tool in the fight against sexual abuse of children,” he said. "That's why we have to act no matter what. We owe it to all the children who are subjected to monstrous abuse."   Meredith Whittaker, the president of the Signal Foundation, lobbied hard against the original measure, saying the organization would leave the European market if the provision was adopted.  “What they propose is in effect a mass surveillance free-for-all, opening up everyone’s intimate and confidential communications, whether government officials, military, investigative journalists, or activists,” she said at the time. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Antimatter Engines Could Launch In Your Lifetime</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA4X9P98ess</link><author>PBS Space Time</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eA4X9P98ess?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 20:15:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g">PBS Space Time</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to Displate for sponsoring the video.

Dan Snow joins After Dark with Anthony Delaney and Maddy Pelling to chat about the brutal reality of sailing in the Age of Sail. They explore the horrifying life at sea for a Royal Navy sailor from the 16th to 19th century, covering the truth about press ganging, shipboard discipline, and the myths vs. realities of naval life.

Dan details the real killers at sea, revealing that more sailors died from disease like scurvy and in catastrophic shipwrecks than in famous naval battles. The conversation also covers the cosmopolitan nature of the crews, the horrors of naval combat, the complex truth about pirates, and what it really took to survive in Nelson's Navy.

It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.Plenty of teams run Kubernetes clusters bigger than ours. , more pods, more ingresses, you name it. In most dimensions, someone out there has us beat.There's one dimension where I suspect we might be near the very top: namespaces. I say that because we keep running into odd behavior in any process that has to keep track of them. In particular, anything that listwatches them ends up using a surprising amount of memory and puts real pressure on the apiserver. This has become one of those scaling quirks you only really notice once you hit a certain threshold. As this memory overhead adds up, efficiency decreases: each byte we have to use for management is a byte we can't put towards user services.The problem gets significantly worse when a daemonset needs to listwatch namespaces or network policies (netpols, which we define per namespace). Since daemonsets run a pod on every node, each of those pods independently performs a listwatch on the same resources. As a result, memory usage increases with the number of nodes.Even worse, these listwatch calls can put significant load on the apiserver. If many daemonset pods restart at once, such as during a rollout, they can overwhelm the server with requests and cause real disruption.A few months ago, if you looked at our nodes, the largest memory consumers were often daemonsets. In particular, Calico and Vector which handle configuring networking and log collection respectively.We had already done some work to reduce Calico’s memory usage,  with the project’s maintainers to make it scale more efficiently. That optimization effort was a big win for us, and it gave us useful insight into how memory behaves when namespaces scale up.To support that work, we set up a staging cluster with several hundred thousand namespaces. We knew that per-namespace network policies (netpols) were the scaling factor that stressed Calico, so we reproduced those conditions to validate our changes.While running those tests, we noticed something strange. Vector, another daemonset, also started consuming large amounts of memory.The pattern looked familiar, and we knew we had another problem to dig into. Vector obviously wasn’t looking at netpols but after poking around a bit we found it was listwatching namespaces from every node in order to allow referencing namespace labels per-pod in the .That gave us an idea: what if Vector didn’t need to use namespaces at all? Was that even possible?As it turns out, yes, they were in use in our configuration, but only to check whether a pod belonged to a user namespace.Conveniently, we realized we could hackily describe that condition in another way, and the memory savings were absolutely worth it.At that point, we were feeling a bit too lucky. We reached out to the Vector maintainers to ask whether disabling this behavior would actually work, and whether they would be open to accepting a contribution if we made it happen.From there, all that was left was to try it. The code change was straightforward. We added a new config option and threaded it through the relevant parts of the codebase.After a few hours of flailing at rustc, a Docker image finally built and we were ready to test the theory. The container ran cleanly with no errors in the logs, which seemed promising.But then we hit a snag. Nothing was being emitted. No logs at all. I couldn’t figure out why.Thankfully, our pal Claude came to the rescue: I rebuilt it (which took like 73 hours because Rust), generated a new image, updating staging, and watched nervously. This time, logs were flowing like normal and…The change saved 50 percent of memory. A huge win. We were ready to wrap it up and ship to production.But then Hieu, one of our teammates, asked a very good question.He was right, something didn’t add up.A few hours later, after repeatedly running my head into a wall, I still hadn’t found anything. There was still a full gibibyte of memory unaccounted for. My whole theory about how this worked was starting to fall apart.I even dropped into the channel to see if anyone had Valgrind experience: anybody got a background in valgrind? seems pretty straightforward to get working so far but it won’t end up interfacing with pyroscope. we’ll have to exec in and gdb manually.In a last-ditch effort to profile it again, I finally saw the answer. It had been staring me in the face the whole time.We actually had  kubernetes_logs sources on user nodes. I had only set the flag on one of them. Once I applied it to both, memory usage dropped to the level we had seen in staging before the extra namespaces were added.Around the same time, our colleague Mark happened to be on-call. He did his usual magic — pulled everything together, tested the rollout in staging, and got it shipped to production.I’ll let the results speak for themselves.  Our largest cluster saw a 1 TiB memory drop, with savings across our other clusters adding up to a total of just over 7 TiB.Debugging infrastructure at scale is rarely about one big “aha” moment. It’s often the result of many small questions, small changes, and small wins stacked up until something clicks.In this case, it started with a memory chart that didn’t look quite right, a teammate asking the right question at the right time, and a bit of persistence. When applied to our whole infrastructure, that simple fix freed up , reduced risk during rollouts, and made the system easier to reason about.Huge thanks to Hieu for pushing the investigation forward, Mark for shipping it smoothly, and the Vector maintainers for being responsive and open to the change.If you’re running daemonsets at scale and seeing unexplained memory pressure, it might be worth asking:Do you really need those namespace labels?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>ChatGPT maker reportedly eyes $1 trillion IPO despite major quarterly losses</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/is-openai-worth-1-trillion-potential-ipo-may-reveal-the-answer/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/openai_treasurechest_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 18:24:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Tuesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told Reuters during a livestream that going public “is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we’ll have.” Now sources familiar with the matter say the ChatGPT maker is preparing for an initial public offering that could value the company at up to $1 trillion, with filings possible as early as the second half of 2026. However, news of the potential IPO comes as the company faces mounting losses that may have reached as much as $11.5 billion in the most recent quarter, according to one estimate.Going public could give OpenAI more efficient access to capital and enable larger acquisitions using public stock, helping finance Altman’s plans to spend trillions of dollars on AI infrastructure, according to people familiar with the company’s thinking who spoke with Reuters. Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar has reportedly told some associates the company targets a 2027 IPO listing, while some financial advisors predict 2026 could be possible.Three people with knowledge of the plans told Reuters that OpenAI has discussed raising $60 billion at the low end in preliminary talks. That figure refers to how much money the company would raise by selling shares to investors, not the total worth of the company. If OpenAI sold that amount of stock while keeping most shares private, the entire company could be valued at $1 trillion or more. The final figures and timing will likely change based on business growth and market conditions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TypeScript Overtakes Python and JavaScript To Claim Top Spot on GitHub</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/10/30/1753252/typescript-overtakes-python-and-javascript-to-claim-top-spot-on-github?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TypeScript overtook Python and JavaScript in August 2025 to become the most used language on GitHub. The shift marked the most significant language change in more than a decade. The language grew by over 1 million contributors in 2025, a 66% increase year over year, and finished August with 2,636,006 monthly contributors. 

Nearly every major frontend framework now scaffolds projects in TypeScript by default. Next.js 15, Astro 3, SvelteKit 2, Qwik, SolidStart, Angular 18, and Remix all generate TypeScript codebases when developers create new projects. Type systems reduce ambiguity and catch errors from large language models before production. A 2025 academic study found 94% of LLM-generated compilation errors were type-check failures. Tooling like Vite, ts-node, Bun, and I.D.E. autoconfig hide boilerplate setup. Among new repositories created in the past twelve months, TypeScript accounted for 5,394,256 projects. That represented a 78% increase from the prior year.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>It’s Getting Harder To Know What’s Real</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EA0Bx2OeDj8</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EA0Bx2OeDj8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:36:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scams are a trillion-dollar industry; keep your loved ones safe with Bitdefender: https://bitdefend.me/90-StarTalk

It‘s one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.

The soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. 
The 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e Régiment Étranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. 
The fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the "Harpie mission". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.
A second mission in French Guiana is called "Titan". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  
At the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entraînement en forêt équatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.

The company faces multiple lawsuits from families who say its chatbots contributed to teenager deaths by suicide.Over the next month, Character.AI says it will ramp down chatbot use among minors by identifying them and placing a two-hour daily limit on their chatbot access. The company plans to use technology to detect underage users based on conversations and interactions on the platform, as well as information from connected social media accounts. On November 25, those users will no longer be able to create or talk to chatbots, though they can still read previous conversations. The company said it is working to build alternative features for users under the age of 18, such as the ability to create videos, stories, and streams with AI characters.Character.AI CEO Karandeep Anand told The New York Times that the company wants to set an example for the industry. “We’re making a very bold step to say for teen users, chatbots are not the way for entertainment, but there are much better ways to serve them,” Anand said in the interview.

(examples: hard-coded secret, weird crypto mode, gnarly logic, ugly code).To try it, replace github.com with 0github.com in any pull-request URL. Under the hood, we split the PR into individual files, and for each file, we ask an LLM to annotate each line with a data structure that we parse into a colored heatmap.Notice how all the example links have a 0 prepended before github.com. This navigates you to our custom diff viewer where we handle the same URL path parameters as github.com. Darker yellows indicate that an area might require more investigation.

DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

Over time, as applications evolved, so did the challenges they faced.This led to the creation of new API styles, each designed to solve specific problems related to performance, flexibility, or real-time updates.In this article, we’ll break down the  that power modern software.In the beginning, there was SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).As the internet began to rise in the late 1990s, companies needed a standardized way for applications to communicate across different platforms and programming languages.SOAP emerged as the first major standard to solve this.SOAP demands that all messages be in  format, and it operates based on a very strict contract called a WSDL (Web Services Description Language).Think of WSDL as a detailed instruction manual that precisely defines every operation you can perform.SOAP is very “verbose,” meaning it uses a lot of text to describe a simple action. All that text for one simple request makes messages large, which  network transmission and processing.Furthermore, the strict WSDL contract creates ; if the server changes any part of the contract, the client will often break.While this was acceptable for large, internal enterprise systems, SOAP was just too heavy and inflexible for the fast moving web and new mobile apps. Developers needed something simpler, lighter, and more flexible that used the web’s own language, HTTP.In response to SOAP’s complexity, REST (Representational State Transfer) emerged and it quickly became the standard for the modern web.REST represented a complete mindset shift. Instead of complex operations defined in a WSDL, REST treats data as “resources” (like ) that you interact with using the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that power the entire web.It is , meaning every request contains all the information needed to process it. It also embraced  over XML, which is far lighter and easier for both humans and machines (especially JavaScript) to read.REST is amazing and runs the majority of the web. But as applications grew, two common problems emerged: Clients often receive more data than they need. You just need a user’s name, but  returns their name, address, entire post history, and a dozen other fields. This is wasted data that slows down apps, especially on mobile networks. You need to show a user’s profile  their latest posts. This requires two separate requests:  and then . This “waterfall” of requests creates noticeable lag.As frontend applications grew richer especially with mobile and single-page apps, developers wanted more control over the data they fetched.This led to the rise of .What if you could ask for  what you need, all in one trip? That’s what Facebook set out to solve when they created in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015.GraphQL is a query language for your API. The most important shift is that the , not the server, defines the shape of the data it needs. Instead of dozens of REST endpoints, you typically have just one (like ) that accepts a query. The client sends a query that precisely describes the data it wants, and the server returns a JSON object in that exact same shape.This single query can pull from multiple sources (like a user database and a post database) and return it all in one response.There is no  (you only get the  and , not the user’s email or post bodies) and no  (you get the user and their posts in one round trip).However, GraphQL introduces its own set of challenges:Complex Server Implementation: Building a GraphQL server (especially with nested data) can be more complex than a simple REST API. The single endpoint and dynamic queries make traditional HTTP caching mechanisms less effective compared to REST.GraphQL shares a fundamental trait with REST: it’s text based (JSON) and works on a client “pull” model, where the client must make a request.For high-performance internal communication between dozens of microservices, the overhead of parsing text and the HTTP request-response pattern is too slow.This need for raw speed led to .Developed by Google and open-sourced in 2015, gRPC is a modern Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework designed for high-performance, language-agnostic communication  services.It’s built for performance in two key ways: It replaces text-based JSON with Protocol Buffers (Protobufs), a highly efficient binary format. This is much faster for computers to  (write) and  (read). It runs on  by default. This modern protocol is far more efficient than HTTP/1.1, supporting features like , where many requests can fly back and forth on a single connection.You define your services and messages in a simple  file. This file acts as a language-agnostic contract, which gRPC uses to generate native code for any language you need (Java, Go, Python, etc.).gRPC is an excellent choice for internal Service-to-Service Communication, especially over low-bandwidth networks.However, its binary format is not human-readable, which can make debugging more challenging. It also isn’t directly supported by browsers, requiring a proxy like gRPC-Web for client-side use.Although highly performant, gRPC is still a request-response pattern: the client asks, the server answers.What if you need a persistent, two-way connection for a live chat app, a stock ticker, or a multiplayer game?That’s where  comes in.Traditional HTTP, which underpins REST, GraphQL, and gRPC, is a  protocol. The client must always initiate the conversation.This becomes inefficient for real-time use cases, because the only way to constantly get updates is to repeatedly ask the server () or keep a request hanging until something happens (). was built to solve exactly this. It creates a ,  communication channel over a single connection.The connection begins as a normal HTTP request, then upgrades to a WebSocket. After that, both client and server can send data to each other whenever they want without new requests.Client-side code example:This model is perfect for live dashboards, multiplayer gaming, or chat applications where the server must push updates instantly.But running WebSockets at scale is not trivial. You have to manage millions of long-lived connections, ensure state consistency across servers, and handle reconnects and failures.Another limitation: the client must initiate the connection first. That works for browsers and apps, but fails for server-to-server events.For example, what if Stripe’s server needs to notify  server that a payment just succeeded? Your server isn’t sitting there with an open connection to Stripe.In such cases, we need a different mechanism:  a .Webhooks are essentially “reverse APIs.” Instead of your application polling an API endpoint for new data, the  calls  (acting as the client) when a specific event occurs. It’s a user-defined HTTP callback.A Webhook is a server to server push model. You provide a URL (an endpoint on your server) to a third party service like GitHub, Stripe, or Slack. When a specific event happens (like a  or a ), that service instantly sends an HTTP POST request with the event data (the payload) to your URL.Webhooks eliminate the need for constant polling, allowing systems to react to events asynchronously and saving resources for both the client and the server.Despite their power, Webhooks require careful implementation: Your endpoint is public. You  verify a signature (like ) to ensure the request is legitimate and not a forgery. Webhooks can fail and be retried. Your endpoint must be , meaning processing the same notification multiple times has the same effect as processing it once.As you can see, there is no single “best” API. The “best” API is the one that fits your use case. In fact, a single, complex application will often use many of them together: or  for its public web and mobile apps. for its internal, high speed microservice communication. for its real time chat feature. to receive events from its payment provider.The journey from SOAP to Webhooks shows an evolution towards more specific, efficient, and flexible tools. The real skill is not knowing just one, but knowing which one to pick for the job.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

It uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to securely connect AI models with data sources while maintaining provider freedom. This gives organizations the ability to run AI-driven automation without relying on a single ecosystem. With a 16-year lifecycle, reproducible builds, instant rollback capabilities, and post-2038 readiness, SLES 16 also doubles down on long-term reliability and transparency.
 
For enterprises, this launch marks a clear step toward embedding intelligence at the infrastructure level. The system can now perform AI-assisted administration via Cockpit or the command line, potentially cutting downtime and operational costs. SUSE's timing might feel late given the AI boom, but its implementation appears deliberate -- balancing innovation with the stability enterprises demand. It's likely to pressure Red Hat and Canonical to follow suit, redefining what "AI-ready" means for Linux in corporate environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federal Reserve Cuts Rates: Here’s What to Watch Now</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ABn4osxkek4</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ABn4osxkek4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 23:31:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the second time this year, although Chair Jerome Powell said a third cut is “not a foregone conclusion.” WSJ’s Nick Timiraos explains the central bank’s split outlook.

From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world’s most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.

Richard Sorge fought against Hitler and National Socialism. Out of conviction for the Communist cause, Richard Sorge acted as a spy in service of Stalin. The man with a German father and a Russian mother was a member of Hitler's NSDAP and was living in Japan, an ally of Nazi-Germany. In 1951 a journalist wrote that, "He had indeed betrayed his fatherland, but in favour of his motherland." And truer words have never been spoken. He was a master spy, duty-bound to the fight against Hitler - a daredevil, a womanizer and a rule breaker. Richard Sorge is not just the model for Ian Fleming's "James Bond" - he was the actual James Bond - a fact that turns this historical documentary into a cinematic thriller.

Soon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel’s remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 

Kimmel’s suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC’s actions left many questioning whether Kimmel’s First Amendment rights were violated.

This incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the “inalienable right” to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

One thing I didn't mention is part of why it had such a big impact: It was a massive improvement in scope, gameplay, and storytelling over the two preceding Dragon Quest titles. With DQIII HD's sales success and its chronological position as the first part of a story trilogy, Square Enix releasing a similar HD-2D remake of the first two titles made perfect sense.And here we are now, with Dragon Quest I and II HD Remake--the other chapters in the Erdrick trilogy, now gussied up with Square Enix's lavish 2D-sprites-on-3D-backgrounds style of graphical presentation. Jumping into these games for the first time in well over two decades, I was surprised to see just how much effort went into "modernizing" them--not just in terms of mechanics, but also to build upon their basic "hero(es) take up arms against an evil force" narratives with more dialogue, setpieces, and story beats. Yet even with all of the enhancements, one game in this bundle clearly comes out as the superior adventure--but still not quite up to the heights of the previous release.If you're at all familiar with Dragon Quest, you know what to expect here: classic fantasy JRPG adventures, packed with random-encounter turn-based combat, dungeon exploration, fetch quests, and vanquishing the forces of darkness with the light of heroism. Dragon Quest I is a strictly solo journey--it's just your brave little hero, going mano-a-mano with the enemy hordes--while DQII uses the series' now-traditional party system. Though the two games play similarly, having a party makes a world of difference in combat: extra meatshields and actions allow for distinct strategies to take shape, making for more dynamic and enjoyable fights.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 Performance For OpenCL Workloads</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/review/radeon-ai-pro-r9700-opencl</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 14:46:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Monday the AMD Radeon AI PRO R9700 officially arrived at Internet retailers and is successfully selling at the $1299 price point.

The milestone comes a mere three months after Nvidia crossed the $4 trillion mark in July, vaulting the company past tech giants like Apple and Microsoft in market valuation but also driving continued fears of an AI investment bubble.Nvidia’s shares have climbed nearly 12-fold since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, as the AI boom propelled the S&P 500 to record highs. Shares of Nvidia stock rose 4.6 percent on Wednesday following the Tuesday announcement at the company’s GTC conference. During a Bloomberg Television interview at the event, Huang dismissed concerns about overheated valuations, saying, “I don’t believe we’re in an AI bubble. All of these different AI models we’re using—we’re using plenty of services and paying happily to do it.”Nvidia expects to ship 20 million units of its latest chips, compared to just 4 million units of the previous Hopper generation over its entire lifetime, Huang said at the conference.

The project is rising on Al Marjan Island, a man-made archipelago in the northernmost emirate, Ras Al Khaimah. Some experts question the project’s long-term prospects and wonder whether competition from tourism powerhouses like Dubai and Abu Dhabi could hurt this new casino.

WSJ examines the megaproject and examines whether building a casino in a deeply conservative society could be a massive mistake.

They have to climb 3,000 meters and cross rivers and glaciers. Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  

With 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  

But they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.

It’s hard to overstate the reliance that entire industries have on three TEEs in particular: Confidential Compute from Nvidia, SEV-SNP from AMD, and SGX and TDX from Intel. All three come with assurances that confidential data and sensitive computing can’t be viewed or altered, even if a server has suffered a complete compromise of the operating kernel.A trio of novel physical attacks raises new questions about the true security offered by these TEES and the exaggerated promises and misconceptions coming from the big and small players using them.The most recent attack, released Tuesday, is known as TEE.fail. It defeats the latest TEE protections from all three chipmakers. The low-cost, low-complexity attack works by placing a small piece of hardware between a single physical memory chip and the motherboard slot it plugs into. It also requires the attacker to compromise the operating system kernel. Once this three-minute attack is completed, Confidential Compute, SEV-SNP, and TDX/SDX can no longer be trusted. Unlike the Battering RAM and Wiretap attacks from last month—which worked only against CPUs using DDR4 memory—TEE.fail works against DDR5, allowing them to work against the latest TEEs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Large Hadron Collider Secrets</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Pm4R1IavUfI</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Pm4R1IavUfI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 29 Oct 2025 13:30:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

And that too, at millions of times per minute?A standard REST API, while great for public use, often creates too much overhead for this internal, high-speed chatter. Because it typically uses text-based formats like JSON. While easy for humans to read, it’s inefficient for services that need to have millions of conversations per day.Instead, these services need to talk in a language that is incredibly compact and fast for computers to process. Plus, they need a pre-agreed set of rules, like a shared blueprint, that guarantees both sides know exactly how to talk to each other without errors.And most importantly, it should offer a good developer experience without sacrificing performance.Modern applications use many distributed services. Yet this creates a core challenge:How to achieve extreme machine-to-machine efficiency? A function call across a network should feel as simple as a local one.The answer is Remote Procedure Call). It’s a protocol designed for high-performance internal communication.I want to introduce Ashutosh as a guest author.He’s a software engineer at YouTube, ex-Google Search, and Microsoft Azure.Connect with him if you want to get deep dives into system design, AI, and software engineering. is a conversational AI and career matchmaker that works on behalf of each person. You spend 15-20 minutes on the phone with him, talking about your experience, your ambitions, and your non-negotiables.Dex then scans thousands of roles and companies to identify the most interesting and compatible opportunities.Once we’ve found a match,  connects you to hiring managers and even helps you prep for interviews.Thousands of exceptional engineers have already signed up, and we’re partnered with many of the UK’s leading start-ups, scale-ups, hedge funds, and tech companies.Don’t waste another day at a job you hate. Speak with Dex today.What Is a Remote Procedure CallRPC is a protocol that allows a function call to cross from one program’s address space into another. This frees the developer from manually managing the raw network connection points () or translating data into a sendable format ().When your code calls a function like , you aren’t concerned with the complex algorithm running inside the math library. You simply trust its public API and know the function’s signature.RPC extends this exact concept across the network.The client application gets a stub object - a local proxy that mirrors the remote service’s API. But its methods contain only the logic to forward the call over the network. When you call a function on this stub, it handles all the complex network communication behind the scenes to execute the code on the server.So, a call like result = paymentService.charge(userId, amount)doesn’t call the payment logic directly. Instead, it calls a local proxy method, which then makes a remote operation. This makes the remote call feel like a simple local library call.Before we go further, let’s understand this first:How Remote Procedure Call Works1. Client Stub (The Local Representative)Your code doesn’t call the remote service directly. Instead, it talks to the  - a local representative whose only job is to act as a stand-in for the remote service.It has the same methods you want to use, for example, “. But its real purpose is to kick off the remote communication process.2. Marshaling (Packing the Message)The stub takes the parameters you provided, like ,  and marshals them. Marshaling is a fancy word for serializing. It means converting the data from a programming language format to a standardized format, so you can send it over the network.Think of it as neatly packing your instructions into a universal shipping container that any server in the world can open. This format is often JSON or a more compact, faster format like Protocol Buffers.The client then sends this packed message across the network to the server, using efficient protocols like HTTP/2. This is the “remote” part of the call.On the server, a “skeleton” is listening. It’s the counterpart of the client stub.Its job is to receive the incoming message and unmarshal (or deserialize) it. Imagine unpacking the shipping container back into a data format the server can understand.The skeleton then calls the actual service method with this unpacked data.After the server finishes its work, the entire process happens in reverse.The skeleton marshals the return value, for example, . Then sends it back across the network, and the client stub unmarshals it.After that, the line of code that made the original call receives the result.Next, I’ll walk you through different RPC failure scenarios and approaches to handle them.Handling Failures in Remote Procedure CallIn a distributed system, the network might be unreliable.Connections drop. Services slow down. Failures occur.A robust RPC implementation isn’t just about successful calls, but also about gracefully handling failures. Here are some strategies:1. Timeouts (Don’t Wait Forever)A timeout is a simple deadline. Whenever the client makes a request, it starts a timer. If it doesn’t receive a response before the timer runs out, it gives up on the call.: Without timeouts, your application could get stuck waiting indefinitely for a response from a slow or dead service. This would tie up resources, such as threads or memory, and could eventually freeze your entire application. Timeouts are the first line of defense to protect the client’s health.2. Retries (If at First Call Doesn’t Succeed)Many network errors are transient: a temporary glitch that quickly resolves itself.Sometimes, a server might take too long to respond, or a network packet might get lost in transit. In these cases, it makes sense to retry the failed request automatically.Important Caveat (Idempotency): Yet retries can be dangerous if the same request causes side effects each time it runs. An operation is idempotent if performing it many times has the same effect as doing it once.Safe to Retry (Idempotent): Getting a user’s account balance. Doing it again won’t change the system’s state.Dangerous to Retry (Not Idempotent): Charging a user’s credit card. Retrying it might cause duplicate payments.So developers must design their systems with idempotency safeguards, such as unique transaction IDs, to retry safely.3. Circuit Breakers (Protecting the System)When a service fails or slows down, sending it more requests will only make things worse.A circuit breaker is a smart pattern that prevents this from happening.If the client notices many failed calls to a service, the circuit breaker “trips” and stops sending requests to that service for a short time. During this period, any new calls fail instantly instead of being sent over the network. Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures. They give the failing service time to recover. And keep the client from wasting time and resources on calls that are likely to fail.4. Deadline Propagation (Don’t Start Work You Can’t Finish)A single user request often triggers a chain of calls between several services. For example, Service A calls B, and B calls C.If the original request has a total timeout of 500ms, and Service A already uses 300ms. Then there’s no point in Service C starting a task that takes another 400ms because the client would have already stopped waiting. fixes this by passing the remaining time limit along with every call. So each service knows the remaining time and can decide whether it can finish its part before the deadline.This approach prevents wasted work and keeps the system fast and responsive. Services can “fail fast” instead of doing long operations for a request that’s already too late to matter.Like every technology, RPC isn’t perfect; it has some strengths, but also tradeoffs to watch out for. Let’s keep going!RPC: The Good, the Bad, and the UglySimple programming model: You can call remote functions just like local ones, which makes your code cleaner and simpler.High performance: RPC uses compact, binary formats that computers can process quickly.Strong typing: Because both sides share a strict contract, it often detects mistakes early before they cause problems.Language interoperability: Client and server can use different programming languages and still communicate smoothly.Tight coupling: If the server’s API changes, the client usually needs to update too, which can slow down development.Less discoverable than REST: You can’t easily test or browse RPC APIs without the specific contract files.Requires specialized tooling: You need special tools to generate the code for the client and server.Abstraction hides network realities: Because remote calls look like local ones, developers might forget they’re dealing with the network and forget to handle timeouts or errors properly.Now let’s look at how RPC actually works in real-world systems and the challenges of running it at scale.Using RPC in real systems comes with several practical challenges. Here are four common ones developers need to handle:1. Service Discovery (How Do Services Find Each Other?)In modern systems, servers are always changing; they’re added, removed, or restarted, often getting new IP addresses.But you can’t just hardcode a server’s location in your code. So how does a client know where to send its request?That’s where  comes in.Think of it like a live, self-updating contact list. You don’t need to remember your friend’s exact home address. Instead, you simply look up their name in your contact list to find the latest address.A central registry (like Consul or Zookeeper) keeps track of all healthy, running services and their locations. So when a client wants to talk to the Payment Service, it asks the registry, “Where can I find it?”.The registry then returns a list of healthy servers, and the client picks one to send the RPC call.2. API Evolution (How Do You Update Services Without Breaking Everything?)When a service adds a new feature, it might need to change a function’s parameters. Things can break if clients do not update right away; this is because of tight coupling.The solution is .Think of a survey form you’ve sent out. You can safely add a new optional question; old forms still work. But if you delete a question or make a new one required, all old forms become invalid.RPCframeworks like gRPC follow strict rules for updating APIs. For example, you can safely add optional fields, but you shouldn’t remove or change existing ones. This allows new versions of a service to run smoothly while older clients keep working.3. Streaming (More Than Just Request and Response)RPC doesn’t limit itself to the “one request, one response” model.Modern frameworks like gRPC support , where data flows continuously between client and server.A regular RPC call is like sending a text message and getting one reply. A streaming RPC is like a live phone call or video stream; both sides can exchange information in real time.Server Streaming: Client sends one request and gets back a stream of responses (e.g., subscribing to live updates).Client Streaming: Client sends a stream of messages and gets back one response (e.g., uploading a large file).Bidirectional Streaming: Both client and server can send messages at any time (e.g., a real-time chat).4. Error Handling & Status Codes (Communicating What Went Wrong)When something fails, the client needs more detail than just an “it failed” message. So it can take the necessary steps.That’s where  come in.Just like HTTP status codes (404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error), RPC frameworks have their own standardized codes:By returning a specific error code, the server tells the client what to do next.Retry the call if the service was temporarily unavailable.Report a user input error if the argument was invalid.Or stop trying if it's impossible to fix the problem automatically.Now that we’ve seen RPC in real-world systems, let’s look at how it compares to other communication patterns.Choosing the Right Communication PatternRPC (gRPC, Thrift): Best for high-performance internal microservices.REST: Ideal for public APIs and resource-oriented operations.GraphQL: Great for client-specific data fetching requirements.Message Queues: Perfect for asynchronous, decoupled workflows.RPC hides most of the network details, but it doesn’t make them disappear; you still need to design for failures.While gRPC with Protocol Buffers has become the new standard for fast, reliable communication between internal services.Remember, a successful RPC setup depends on supporting systems. So service discovery, tracing, and monitoring are necessary to keep everything running smoothly.👋 I’d like to thank  for writing this newsletter!Plus, don’t forget to connect with him on:He offers good deep dives into system design, AI, and software engineering.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 180,001+ readers strong, very close to 181k.

available by setting  at build time.
Many workloads spend around 10% less time in the garbage collector, but some
workloads see a reduction of up to 40%!It’s production-ready and already in use at Google, so we encourage you to
try it out.
We know some workloads don’t benefit as much, or even at all, so your feedback
is crucial to helping us move forward.
Based on the data we have now, we plan to make it the default in Go 1.26.What follows is a blog post based on Michael Knyszek’s GopherCon 2025 talk.
We’ll update this blog post with a link to the talk once it’s available online.Tracing garbage collectionBefore we discuss Green Tea let’s get us all on the same page about garbage
collection.The purpose of garbage collection is to automatically reclaim and reuse memory
no longer used by the program.To this end, the Go garbage collector concerns itself with  and
.In the context of the Go runtime,  are Go values whose underlying
memory is allocated from the heap.
Heap objects are created when the Go compiler can’t figure out how else to allocate
memory for a value.
For example, the following code snippet allocates a single heap object: the backing
store for a slice of pointers.var x = make([]*int, 10) // global
The Go compiler can’t allocate the slice backing store anywhere except the heap,
since it’s very hard, and maybe even impossible, for it to know how long  will
refer to the object for. are just numbers that indicate the location of a Go value in memory,
and they’re how a Go program references objects.
For example, to get the pointer to the beginning of the object allocated in the
last code snippet, we can write:Go’s garbage collector follows a strategy broadly referred to as tracing garbage
collection, which just means that the garbage collector follows, or traces, the
pointers in the program to identify which objects the program is still using.More specifically, the Go garbage collector implements the mark-sweep algorithm.
This is much simpler than it sounds.
Imagine objects and pointers as a sort of graph, in the computer science sense.
Objects are nodes, pointers are edges.The mark-sweep algorithm operates on this graph, and as the name might suggest,
proceeds in two phases.In the first phase, the mark phase, it walks the object graph from well-defined
source edges called .
Think global and local variables.
Then, it  everything it finds along the way as , to avoid going in
circles.
This is analogous to your typical graph flood algorithm, like a depth-first or
breadth-first search.Next is the sweep phase.
Whatever objects were not visited in our graph walk are unused, or ,
by the program.
We call this state unreachable because it is impossible with normal safe Go code
to access that memory anymore, simply through the semantics of the language.
To complete the sweep phase, the algorithm simply iterates through all the
unvisited nodes and marks their memory as free, so the memory allocator can reuse
it.You may think I’m oversimplifying a bit here.
Garbage collectors are frequently referred to as , and .
And you’d be partially right, there are more complexities.For example, this algorithm is, in practice, executed concurrently with your
regular Go code.
Walking a graph that’s mutating underneath you brings challenges.
We also parallelize this algorithm, which is a detail that’ll come up again
later.But trust me when I tell you that these details are mostly separate from the
core algorithm.
It really is just a simple graph flood at the center.Let’s walk through an example.
Navigate through the slideshow below to follow along.After all that, I think we have a handle on what the Go garbage collector is actually doing.
This process seems to work well enough today, so what’s the problem?Well, it turns out we can spend  of time executing this particular algorithm in some
programs, and it adds substantial overhead to nearly every Go program.
It’s not that uncommon to see Go programs spending 20% or more of their CPU time in the
garbage collector.Let’s break down where that time is being spent.At a high level, there are two parts to the cost of the garbage collector.
The first is how often it runs, and the second is how much work it does each time it runs.
Multiply those two together, and you get the total cost of the garbage collector.
    Total GC cost = Number of GC cycles × Average cost per GC cycle
    But for now let’s focus only on the second part, the cost per cycle.From years of poring over CPU profiles to try to improve performance, we know two big things
about Go’s garbage collector.The first is that about 90% of the cost of the garbage collector is spent marking,
and only about 10% is sweeping.
Sweeping turns out to be much easier to optimize than marking,
and Go has had a very efficient sweeper for many years.The second is that, of that time spent marking, a substantial portion, usually at least 35%, is
simply spent  on accessing heap memory.
This is bad enough on its own, but it completely gums up the works on what makes modern CPUs
actually fast.“A microarchitectural disaster”What does “gum up the works” mean in this context?
The specifics of modern CPUs can get pretty complicated, so let’s use an analogy.Imagine the CPU driving down a road, where that road is your program.
The CPU wants to ramp up to a high speed, and to do that it needs to be able to see far ahead of it,
and the way needs to be clear.
But the graph flood algorithm is like driving through city streets for the CPU.
The CPU can’t see around corners and it can’t predict what’s going to happen next.
To make progress, it constantly has to slow down to make turns, stop at traffic lights, and avoid
pedestrians.
It hardly matters how fast your engine is because you never get a chance to get going.Let’s make that more concrete by looking at our example again.
I’ve overlaid the heap here with the path that we took.
Each left-to-right arrow represents a piece of scanning work that we did
and the dashed arrows show how we jumped around between bits of scanning work.Notice that we were jumping all over memory doing tiny bits of work in each place.
In particular, we’re frequently jumping between pages, and between different parts of pages.Modern CPUs do a lot of caching.
Going to main memory can be up to 100x slower than accessing memory that’s in our cache.
CPU caches are populated with memory that’s been recently accessed, and memory that’s nearby to
recently accessed memory.
But there’s no guarantee that any two objects that point to each other will  be close to each
other in memory.
The graph flood doesn’t take this into account.Quick side note: if we were just stalling fetches to main memory, it might not be so bad.
CPUs issue memory requests asynchronously, so even slow ones could overlap if the CPU could see
far enough ahead.
But in the graph flood, every bit of work is small, unpredictable, and highly dependent on the
last, so the CPU is forced to wait on nearly every individual memory fetch.And unfortunately for us, this problem is only getting worse.
There’s an adage in the industry of “wait two years and your code will get faster.”But Go, as a garbage collected language that relies on the mark-sweep algorithm, risks the opposite.
“Wait two years and your code will get slower.”
The trends in modern CPU hardware are creating new challenges for garbage collector performance:Non-uniform memory access.
For one, memory now tends to be associated with subsets of CPU cores.
Accesses by  CPU cores to that memory are slower than before.
In other words, the cost of a main memory access depends on which CPU core is accessing
it.
It’s non-uniform, so we call this non-uniform memory access, or NUMA for short.Reduced memory bandwidth.
Available memory bandwidth per CPU is trending downward over time.
This just means that while we have more CPU cores, each core can submit relatively fewer
requests to main memory, forcing non-cached requests to wait longer than before.
Above, we looked at a sequential marking algorithm, but the real garbage collector performs this
algorithm in parallel.
This scales well to a limited number of CPU cores, but the shared queue of objects to scan becomes
a bottleneck, even with careful design.Modern hardware features.
New hardware has fancy features like vector instructions, which let us operate on a lot of data at once.
While this has the potential for big speedups, it’s not immediately clear how to make that work for
marking because marking does so much irregular and often small pieces of work.Finally, this brings us to Green Tea, our new approach to the mark-sweep algorithm.
The key idea behind Green Tea is astonishingly simple:Work with pages, not objects.Sounds trivial, right?
And yet, it took a lot of work to figure out how to order the object graph walk and what we needed to
track to make this work well in practice.More concretely, this means:Instead of scanning objects we scan whole pages.Instead of tracking objects on our work list, we track whole pages.We still need to mark objects at the end of the day, but we’ll track marked objects locally to each
page, rather than across the whole heap.Let’s see what this means in practice by looking at our example heap again, but this time
running Green Tea instead of the straightforward graph flood.As above, navigate through the annotated slideshow to follow along.Let’s come back around to our driving analogy.
Are we finally getting on the highway?Let’s recall our graph flood picture before.We jumped around a whole lot, doing little bits of work in different places.
The path taken by Green Tea looks very different.Green Tea, in contrast, makes fewer, longer left-to-right passes over pages A and B.
The longer these arrows, the better, and with bigger heaps, this effect can be much stronger.
 the magic of Green Tea.It’s also our opportunity to ride the highway.This all adds up to a better fit with the microarchitecture.
We can now scan objects closer together with much higher probability, so
there’s a better chance we can make use of our caches and avoid main memory.
Likewise, per-page metadata is more likely to be in cache.
Tracking pages instead of objects means work lists are smaller,
and less pressure on work lists means less contention and fewer CPU stalls.And speaking of the highway, we can take our metaphorical engine into gears we’ve never been able to
before, since now we can use vector hardware!If you’re only vaguely familiar with vector hardware, you might be confused as to how we can use it here.
But besides the usual arithmetic and trigonometric operations,
recent vector hardware supports two things that are valuable for Green Tea:
very wide registers, and sophisticated bit-wise operations.Most modern x86 CPUs support AVX-512, which has 512-bit wide vector registers.
This is wide enough to hold all of the metadata for an entire page in just two registers,
right on the CPU, enabling Green Tea to work on an entire page in just a few straight-line
instructions.
Vector hardware has long supported basic bit-wise operations on whole vector registers, but starting
with AMD Zen 4 and Intel Ice Lake, it also supports a new bit vector “Swiss army knife” instruction
that enables a key step of the Green Tea scanning process to be done in just a few CPU cycles.
Together, these allow us to turbo-charge the Green Tea scan loop.This wasn’t even an option for the graph flood, where we’d be jumping between scanning objects that
are all sorts of different sizes.
Sometimes you needed two bits of metadata and sometimes you needed ten thousand.
There simply wasn’t enough predictability or regularity to use vector hardware.If you want to nerd out on some of the details, read along!
Otherwise, feel free to skip ahead to the evaluation.To get a sense of what AVX-512 GC scanning looks like, take a look at the diagram below.There’s a lot going on here and we could probably fill an entire blog post just on how this works.
For now, let’s just break it down at a high level:First we fetch the “seen” and “scanned” bits for a page.
Recall, these are one bit per object in the page, and all objects in a page have the same size.Next, we compare the two bit sets.
Their union becomes the new “scanned” bits, while their difference is the “active objects” bitmap,
which tells us which objects we need to scan in this pass over the page (versus previous passes).We take the difference of the bitmaps and “expand” it, so that instead of one bit per object,
we have one bit per word (8 bytes) of the page.
We call this the “active words” bitmap.
For example, if the page stores 6-word (48-byte) objects, each bit in the active objects bitmap
will be copied to 6 bits in the active words bitmap.
Like so: → 000000 000000 111111 111111 ...Next we fetch the pointer/scalar bitmap for the page.
Here, too, each bit corresponds to a word (8 bytes) of the page, and it tells us whether that word
stores a pointer.
This data is managed by the memory allocator.Now, we take the intersection of the pointer/scalar bitmap and the active words bitmap.
The result is the “active pointer bitmap”: a bitmap that tells us the location of every
pointer in the entire page contained in any live object we haven’t scanned yet.Finally, we can iterate over the memory of the page and collect all the pointers.
Logically, we iterate over each set bit in the active pointer bitmap,
load the pointer value at that word, and write it back to a buffer that
will later be used to mark objects seen and add pages to the work list.
Using vector instructions, we’re able to do this 64 bytes at a time,
in just a couple instructions.Part of what makes this fast is the  instruction,
part of the “Galois Field New Instructions” x86 extension,
and the bit manipulation Swiss army knife we referred to above.
It’s the real star of the show, since it lets us do step (3) in the scanning kernel very, very
efficiently.
It performs a bit-wise affine
transformations,
treating each byte in a vector as itself a mathematical vector of 8 bits
and multiplying it by an 8x8 bit matrix.
This is all done over the Galois field,
which just means multiplication is AND and addition is XOR.
The upshot of this is that we can define a few 8x8 bit matrices for each
object size that perform exactly the 1:n bit expansion we need.For the full assembly code, see this
file.
The “expanders” use different matrices and different permutations for each size class,
so they’re in a separate file
that’s written by a code generator.
Aside from the expansion functions, it’s really not a lot of code.
Most of it is dramatically simplified by the fact that we can perform most of the above
operations on data that sits purely in registers.
And, hopefully soon this assembly code will be replaced with Go code!Credit to Austin Clements for devising this process.
It’s incredibly cool, and incredibly fast!So that’s it for how it works.
How much does it actually help?It can be quite a lot.
Even without the vector enhancements, we see reductions in garbage collection CPU costs
between 10% and 40% in our benchmark suite.
For example, if an application spends 10% of its time in the garbage collector, then that
would translate to between a 1% and 4% overall CPU reduction, depending on the specifics of
the workload.
A 10% reduction in garbage collection CPU time is roughly the modal improvement.
(See the GitHub issue for some of these details.)We’ve rolled Green Tea out inside Google, and we see similar results at scale.We’re still rolling out the vector enhancements,
but benchmarks and early results suggest this will net an additional 10% GC CPU reduction.While most workloads benefit to some degree, there are some that don’t.Green Tea is based on the hypothesis that we can accumulate enough objects to scan on a
single page in one pass to counteract the costs of the accumulation process.
This is clearly the case if the heap has a very regular structure: objects of the same size at a
similar depth in the object graph.
But there are some workloads that often require us to scan only a single object per page at a time.
This is potentially worse than the graph flood because we might be doing more work than before while
trying to accumulate objects on pages and failing.The implementation of Green Tea has a special case for pages that have only a single object to scan.
This helps reduce regressions, but doesn’t completely eliminate them.However, it takes a lot less per-page accumulation to outperform the graph flood
than you might expect.
One surprise result of this work was that scanning a mere 2% of a page at a time
can yield improvements over the graph flood.Green Tea is already available as an experiment in the recent Go 1.25 release and can be enabled
by setting the environment variable  to  at build time.
This doesn’t include the aforementioned vector acceleration.We expect to make it the default garbage collector in Go 1.26, but you’ll still be able to opt-out
with GOEXPERIMENT=nogreenteagc at build time.
Go 1.26 will also add vector acceleration on newer x86 hardware, and include a whole bunch of
tweaks and improvements based on feedback we’ve collected so far.If you can, we encourage you to try at Go tip-of-tree!
If you prefer to use Go 1.25, we’d still love your feedback.
See this GitHub
comment with some details on
what diagnostics we’d be interested in seeing, if you can share, and the preferred channels for
reporting feedback.Before we wrap up this blog post, let’s take a moment to talk about the journey that got us here.
The human element of the technology.The core of Green Tea may seem like a single, simple idea.
Like the spark of inspiration that just one single person had.But that’s not true at all.
Green Tea is the result of work and ideas from many people over several years.
Several people on the Go team contributed to the ideas, including Michael Pratt, Cherry Mui, David
Chase, and Keith Randall.
Microarchitectural insights from Yves Vandriessche, who was at Intel at the time, also really helped
direct the design exploration.
There were a lot of ideas that didn’t work, and there were a lot of details that needed figuring out.
Just to make this single, simple idea viable.The seeds of this idea go all the way back to 2018.
What’s funny is that everyone on the team thinks someone else thought of this initial idea.Green Tea got its name in 2024 when Austin worked out a prototype of an earlier version while cafe
crawling in Japan and drinking LOTS of matcha!
This prototype showed that the core idea of Green Tea was viable.
And from there we were off to the races.Throughout 2025, as Michael implemented and productionized Green Tea, the ideas evolved and changed even
further.This took so much collaborative exploration because Green Tea is not just an algorithm, but an entire
design space.
One that we don’t think any of us could’ve navigated alone.
It’s not enough to just have the idea, but you need to figure out the details and prove it.
And now that we’ve done it, we can finally iterate.The future of Green Tea is bright.Once again, please try it out by setting  and let us know how it goes!
We’re really excited about this work and want to hear from you!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If you could ask Chopin one question, what would it be? 🤔</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LeejUZloJmM</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LeejUZloJmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 23:19:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[https://patreon.com/BenLaude

"The non-profit would've used the funding to help prevent supply chain attacks; create a new automated, proactive review process for new PyPI packages; and make the project's work easily transferable to other open-source package managers," reports The Register. From the report: The programming non-profit's deputy executive director Loren Crary said in a blog post today that the National Science Founation (NSF) had offered $1.5 million to address structural vulnerabilities in Python and the Python Package Index (PyPI), but the Foundation quickly became dispirited with the terms (PDF) of the grant it would have to follow. "These terms included affirming the statement that we 'do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI [diversity, equity, and inclusion], or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws,'" Crary noted. "This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole."
 
To make matters worse, the terms included a provision that if the PSF was found to have voilated that anti-DEI diktat, the NSF reserved the right to claw back any previously disbursed funds, Crary explained. "This would create a situation where money we'd already spent could be taken back, which would be an enormous, open-ended financial risk," the PSF director added. The PSF's mission statement enshrines a commitment to supporting and growing "a diverse and international community of Python programmers," and the Foundation ultimately decided it wasn't willing to compromise on that position, even for what would have been a solid financial boost for the organization. "The PSF is a relatively small organization, operating with an annual budget of around $5 million per year, with a staff of just 14," Crary added, noting that the $1.5 million would have been the largest grant the Foundation had ever received - but it wasn't worth it if the conditions were undermining the PSF's mission. The PSF board voted unanimously to withdraw its grant application.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mao Zedong vs Deng Xiaoping: Who Was The Real Founder Of Modern China?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTnNReBeBZc</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/nTnNReBeBZc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 22:01:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Mao brought China out of its standstill and into the realms of the great powers of the world.

More and more families and schools are setting clear boundaries to counter the constant distraction of social media.

Studies have linked excessive smartphone use to depression, anxiety, and difficulties concentrating. This documentary follows several families and schools that greatly restrict smartphone use for children and young people. Martin and Ursula Novotny in Sevelen, Switzerland, are convinced that phones and social media are just as addictive as alcohol or drugs. They waited until their children were older before giving them a cell phone of their own. The Lyceum Alpinum boarding school in Switzerland is equally strict: During the day, all devices remain locked away; older students get their cell phones back after class, while younger students only get them for two hours in the evening. The result: The children are significantly less distracted in class and have actual conversations at breaktime. How much screen time is healthy, and at what age does it make sense to give a child a smartphone? Child and adolescent psychotherapist Nady Mirian explains which parental rules work for social media. The schools and families featured in the documentary are not opposed to new technologies, but they advocate responsible use. Is it still realistic for children today to grow up without a smartphone — and could it actually be preferable?

Pipelex is a DSL and a Python runtime for repeatable AI workflows. Think Dockerfile/SQL for multi-step LLM pipelines: you declare steps and interfaces; any model/provider can fill them.Why this instead of yet another workflow builder?- Declarative, not glue code: you state what to do; the runtime figures out how.
- Agent-first: each step carries natural-language context (purpose, inputs/outputs with meaning) so LLMs can follow, audit, and optimize. Our MCP server enables agents to run pipelines but also to build new pipelines on demand.
- Open standard under MIT: language spec, runtime, API server, editor extensions, MCP server, n8n node.
- Composable: pipes can call other pipes, created by you or shared in the community.Why a domain-specific language?- We need context, meaning and nuances preserved in a structured syntax that both humans and LLMs can understand
- We need determinism, control, and reproducibility that pure prompts can't deliver
- Bonus: editors, diffs, semantic coloring, easy sharing, search & replace, version control, linters…Initially, we just wanted to solve every use-case with LLMs but kept rebuilding the same agentic patterns across different projects. So we challenged ourselves to keep the code generic and separate from use-case specifics, which meant modeling workflows from the relevant knowledge and know-how.Unlike existing code/no-code frameworks for AI workflows, our abstraction layer doesn't wrap APIs, it transcribes business logic into a structured, unambiguous script executable by software and AI. Hence the "declarative" aspect: the script says what should be done, not how to do it. It's like a Dockerfile or SQL for AI workflows.Additionally, we wanted the language to be LLM-friendly. Classic programming languages hide logic and context in variable names, functions, and comments: all invisible to the interpreter. In Pipelex, these elements are explicitly stated in natural language, giving AI full visibility: it's all logic and context, with minimal syntax.Then, we didn't want to write Pipelex scripts ourselves so we dogfooded: we built a Pipelex workflow that writes Pipelex workflows. It's in the MCP and CLI: "pipelex build pipe '…'" runs a multi-step, structured generation flow that produces a validated workflow ready to execute with "pipelex run". Then you can iterate on it yourself or with any coding agent.What’s included: Python library, FastAPI and Docker, MCP server, n8n node, VS Code extension.1. Build a workflow: did the language work for you or against you?
2. Agent/MCP workflows and n8n node usability.
3. Suggest new kinds of pipes and other AI models we could integrate
4. Looking for OSS contributors to the core library but also to share pipes with the community- Connectors: Pipelex doesn’t integrate with “your apps”, we focus on the cognitive steps, and you can integrate through code/API or using MCP or n8n
- Visualization: we need to generate flow-charts
- The pipe builder is still buggy
- Run it yourself: we don’t yet provide a hosted Pipelex API, it’s in the works
- Cost-tracking: we only track LLM costs, not image generation or OCR costs yet
- Caching and reasoning options: not supported yetThanks for reading. If you try Pipelex, tell us exactly where it hurts, that’s the most valuable feedback we can get.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unveiling The Mystery of Death</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lxQSWGQH9Gg</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lxQSWGQH9Gg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 16:13:15 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Neil deGrasse Tyson, with co-host Matt Kirshen and “Geek-in-Chief” Charles Liu, takes a look at the monsters that have terrified us, like the zombies in The Last of Us or Godzilla, and the scary speculative science behind them. Are black holes cosmic cookie monsters?

Charles shares his favorite creature, Godzilla, as Japan’s way of processing nuclear trauma. What does it mean that the monster came from radiation? Neil recalls his childhood fascination with Rodan’s supersonic flight and asks: could any creature that big actually move? We put monster physics to the test. What would happen if Godzilla really walked the Earth? Would his bones shatter under his own weight?

From King Kong’s tragic fall to Frankenstein’s electric creation, we trace how monsters evolved alongside scientific discovery. How did Benjamin Franklin’s experiments with electricity inspire Mary Shelley? Why are we drawn to the undead like zombies in The Last of Us to infected humans in Body Snatchers? Could climate change or fungi actually create a real-life zombie apocalypse?

And what if the scariest monsters… are humans themselves? From Finding Nemo to The Twilight Zone, Neil, Matt, and Charles examine how fear of the unfamiliar drives us to monstrous behavior. Can understanding physics and biology make the terrifying beautiful? Do monsters endure because they hold up a mirror to our imagination, our fears, and the edges of our humanity?

The deal values Microsoft’s stake in OpenAI at approximately $135 billion and extends the exclusive partnership through 2032 while giving both companies more freedom to pursue AGI independently.The partnership began in 2019 when Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI. Since then, Microsoft has provided billions in cloud computing resources through Azure and used OpenAI’s models as the basis of products like Copilot. The new agreement maintains Microsoft as OpenAI’s frontier model partner and preserves Microsoft’s exclusive rights to OpenAI’s IP and Azure API exclusivity until the threshold of AGI is reached.Under a previous arrangement, OpenAI alone would determine when it achieved AGI, which is a nebulous concept that is difficult to define. The revised deal requires an independent expert panel to verify that claim, a change that adds oversight to a determination with billions of dollars at stake. When the panel confirms that AGI has been reached, Microsoft’s intellectual property rights to OpenAI’s research methods will expire, and the revenue-sharing arrangement between the companies will end, though payments will continue over a longer period.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jimo Borjigin: Do Near-Death Experiences Prove an Afterlife? | Closer To Truth Chats</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwYs2c5BgjU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lwYs2c5BgjU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 28 Oct 2025 15:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more CTT Chats here: https://t.ly/jJI7e

What actually happens in the brain during a near-death experience? Neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin shares groundbreaking research that reveals dramatic surges in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the moments before death. These chemical floods may explain the feelings of euphoria, tunnels of light, and out-of-body sensations reported by millions. Is this evidence of the afterlife—or proof that the dying brain creates its own final visions?

--

Long ago, a temple was built near the site of a naval battle that concluded the long and gruesome conflict known as the Genpei Wars. For centuries after, performers throughout the country honored this tragic past in beautiful, haunting performances. But the most skilled storyteller of all was a monk from this very temple. Jeffrey Angles digs into the Japanese legend of Hōichi the earless.

DESCRIPTION
When FundApps exploded from 20 to 50+ engineers in just one year, their old "everyone does support" model crumbled spectacularly. Software engineer Flavia Circiumaru and host Hannes Lowette dive deep into how this London-based regulatory compliance company transformed from a support-free-for-all to a streamlined powerhouse.

Flavia Circiumaru reveals the behind-the-scenes story of building a three-desk support system that turned their support team into the ultimate connector, bridging customers, developers, and business teams like never before. From battling context-switching nightmares to creating communication magic, Flavia and Hannes explore actionable insights on scaling support without losing your sanity.

The twist? Their ultimate goal is to make support so seamless that dedicated teams won't even be needed. Talk about engineering your way out of a job!

If someone steals it, they do not just break into one account, they often get access to every other place where the user reused that same password.That is why  is not optional. It is our responsibility as developers to store passwords in a form that remains safe even if the database is stolen.In this article, we will break down  from first principles. We will begin with , then climb upward to the correct techniques and the reasoning behind them.1. Storing in Plain Text: The Worst WayThe absolute worst thing you can do is store a password as plain text. This means if a user signs up with the password “Pa$$w0rd123”, your database stores the literal string “Pa$$w0rd123”. An attacker who finds an SQL injection vulnerability can dump your entire  table in one query. There is nothing to decode or crack. They instantly have the passwords to every user’s account.SELECT email, password FROM users; A developer, DBA, support engineer or cloud vendor with read access can export the entire password list in seconds, and you would never know it happened. Many breaches are not hackers, they are insiders.With plain text, there is no second line of protection. You cannot “undo” the exposure. Once seen, it is gone forever.Now that we have established the worst practice, let us examine the first step in doing better: .2. Simple Hashing: Slightly Better But Still BrokenA  is supposed to be a one-way transformation.Think of it like a blender. You can drop a banana and strawberry in, blend them, and get a smoothie. You can recognize the smoothie as “fruit mix” but you can never reverse it back into the original fruits.That is the idea behind a hash. You feed in a password and get a fixed-length output that cannot be reversed.Early systems used fast general-purpose hash algorithms like  and  for this.You would run “Pa$$w0rd123” through MD5 and get a hash like:e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e It looks random and irreversible. It looks safe. Sounds good, right?Here is the twist — it is not.Why fast hashing ruins securityAlgorithms like MD5, SHA-1, and even SHA-256 are designed to be extremely fast. That is great for file integrity and signatures, but disastrous for passwords. Modern GPUs can compute billions of these hashes per second, which means an attacker can brute-force weak passwords almost instantly.Worse, attackers do not even have to brute-force from scratch. They can use something called .Rainbow Tables are massive precomputed dictionaries where attackers hash millions of common passwords in advance and store the mapping. A lookup is enough to reveal the plaintext password.For MD5, a tiny fragment of a rainbow table might look like: The attacker steals your  table and finds a list of password hashes. They see the hash 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99 for a user. Instead of trying to “guess” the password, they just look up this hash in their giant rainbow table. They instantly find the matching plaintext password: “password”.No brute force. No guessing. Just a dictionary lookup.This method works because old, fast hashing functions (like MD5 or SHA-1) always produce the same exact hash for the same exact input.This is why “simple hashing” is still insecure. The fix is not just “hash it”, it is “hash it the right way.”3. The Right Kind of HASHA secure password hashing function must be , , and computationally expensive on purpose.The idea is simple: if every password attempt takes real time and real resources, large-scale cracking becomes impractical even with modern GPUs.Why slow hashing kills rainbow tablesRainbow tables only work when hashing is fast and deterministic. Slow and adaptive hash functions make precomputation economically pointless.To generate a rainbow table now, an attacker would have to spend years and extreme hardware cost just to compute the table before even attacking.Popular Slow Hashing OptionsHere are the three widely used hashing options:This has been the industry standard for a long time. Its key feature is a configurable . You can tell it “make this hash take 100 milliseconds.” As computers get faster in the future, you can just increase the cost factor to keep it slow.This was designed to be “memory hard.” It forces the hashing process to consume significant RAM, which makes pre-computation and GPU attacks extremely inefficient. GPUs excel at raw compute but struggle when memory is the bottleneck.This is the modern preferred option. It won the official Password Hashing Competition in 2015. It is resistant to GPU attacks, highly configurable (you can balance its memory, CPU, and parallelism needs), and is the top recommendation by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project). Use  if your language and framework support it. If not,  is an extremely solid and widely supported alternative.Slow hashing removes the attacker’s “shortcut”.But slow hashing by itself still has a weakness. The same password still produces the same hash. This is where  enters the picture.A “salt” is simply a unique, random string generated for each user.Returning to the smoothie analogy: a salt is like adding a different mystery ingredient to every person’s blend before mixing. Even if two people start with the same fruits (same password), the final smoothie looks completely different.You do not hash the raw password. You hash: Two users with the same password now produce completely different hashes.Alice password = “123456”
Alice salt     = “abc_salt”
Stored hash    = H(”123456abc_salt”)

Bob password   = “123456”
Bob salt       = “xyz_salt”
Stored hash    = H(”123456xyz_salt”)The salt must be ,  (at least 16 bytes), and .You must  use usernames, timestamps, or predictable data. Use a cryptographically secure random generator, for example: in NodeWhy salting kills rainbow tablesRainbow tables depend on the assumption that the same password always leads to the same hash. Salting breaks that. Now the attacker would need a separate precomputed table for , which is mathematically and economically infeasible.The salt is . You store it right next to the hash. You need it later to re-compute the hash during login. In many modern implementations (bcrypt, Argon2, PBKDF2), the salt is automatically generated and embedded inside the final hash output itself so you never handle salts manually.So far we have made two things clear:Hashing must be slow and adaptiveHashes must be salted to prevent precomputation and duplicate patternsThose two alone already raise the bar enormously. But there is still one more defensive layer that can make a breach dramatically less useful to an attacker even if they steal both the hashes and the salts.That additional layer is called .Peppering adds one more defensive layer by mixing in a secret value that is never stored in the database. Even if an attacker steals your user table (hashes and salts), they still cannot verify guesses without the pepper.A  is a random secret value (for example 32 bytes) that is combined with the password and salt before hashing. It does not replace salts or slow hashing. It complements them.If salt is a per-user ingredient added to each smoothie, the pepper is the restaurant’s master secret sauce stored in a separate locked kitchen. The smoothies can be stolen. The recipe cannot.Where is the pepper stored?Unlike salts, peppers must be treated as secrets and kept outside the database.Typical storage locations:A secure environment variable (e.g., )A secrets management system (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Google Secret Manager).Peppers should never sit in the same system that holds the hashes.Two common pepper patternsOne secret value used for the whole application. Simple to implement. Must be carefully protected.Per-user pepper stored externally: A different secret per user kept in a separate secure store (HSM or encrypted key-value store). Harder to manage but limits blast radius if one pepper is leaked.A typical pipeline with salt and pepper:Imagine an attacker steals your . They have all the usernames, all the hashes, and all the salts.Without pepper, they can immediately begin brute-forcing, because they know the hashing function and inputs except the password. With pepper, they are missing a required input.They are trying to solve:hash(password + salt)   ❌   (what attacker assumes)But the real stored hash came from:hash(password + salt + pepper)   ✅6. Putting It All TogetherLet’s see how these pieces fit in a real application.A user signs up with their password (e.g., “Pa$$w0rd123”).Your server generates a cryptographically secure .Your server retrieves the application’s secret  from environment variable.Your server uses a library (like  or ) to hash the password.The library combines the (password + salt + pepper) and runs them through the slow hash algorithm.The server stores the  and  in the  table. The pepper is never stored.A user tries to log in with their email and password (e.g., “Pa$$w0rd123”).The server retrieves the user’s  and  from the database (using their email).The server retrieves the application’s secret  from the environment variable.The server combines the  with the  and .The server hands this combined string  the  to the  (or equivalent) function.The library function re-hashes the user’s input using that same salt, and securely compares the two.If they match, the user is authenticated. If not, the password was wrong.Practical Code Example (Node.js)Here is a clean and minimal example using  in Node.js where the library handles salt generation for you.7. The “Best” Way? Don’t Store Passwords at All.There is one more option. Do not keep passwords. Delegate authentication to a trusted identity provider instead.You have seen this everywhere: “Sign in with Google,” “Sign in with Facebook,” or “Sign in with GitHub.”Under the hood these flows use standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. You never store or manage user passwords. You shift the entire security burden to experts at Google, Microsoft, or Apple. A breach of your database is less catastrophic because you do not have any passwords to steal. You create a dependency on a third party. If Google’s login service is down, your users cannot log in. It also may not be suitable for all types of applications.While building authentication at , I chose OAuth (Google and GitHub login) to avoid the complexity and risk of password management. For users who did not use Google accounts (e.g., Outlook or Hotmail), I added email OTP-based authentication as a fallback instead of storing passwords.Protecting user passwords is a fundamental responsibility for anyone building software. When you do it correctly, your users stay safe and your product earns trust. When you get it wrong, the fallout can be immediate, public, and irreversible.Here are the non-negotiable rules: store passwords in plain text. use old, fast hashes like MD5 or SHA-1. use a modern, slow, adaptive hash (like  or ). use a unique  for every single user (which modern libraries do for you). using a secret  (stored outside the DB) to protect against database theft., use a trusted third party provider (like “Sign in with Google”) and do not handle passwords at all.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Born as a more specific branch of the liminal-space genre, The Backrooms is the all-encompassing name for a horror lore bible of sorts that's been handcrafted by communities online over several years. Each inhuman monster and each unnerving location becomes a chapter of a horror universe that the internet built together. It's grown so big that it's spawned dozens of related games, an upcoming horror movie from A24, and what feels like an endless stream of YouTube content to watch. But through it all, Escape The Backrooms has remained one of the most popular portrayals of the fictional world, and now plays like a labyrinthine museum to one of the internet's favorite scary stories.Escape The Backrooms is a first-person defenseless horror game for up to four players in co-op. It's been popular as a Steam Early Access title for a few years, but its 1.0 version has finally arrived. In Escape The Backrooms, you'll explore a great number of the internet-created pocket universes of the wider Backrooms lore. Each "room" of The Backrooms presents a different take on liminal horror. This includes the iconic yellow labyrinth that kicked off the entire subgenre, as well as other popular landing spots, like Level Fun, the Poolrooms, and the Grassrooms. One of the game's best feats is simply the number of locations it explores. By nature of being owned by, well, everyone in a sense, lore is played fast and loose. Escape The Backrooms does well in involving many of these different rooms, giving players a history lesson on its unsettling universe.The gameplay loop is very simple. You'll explore each eerie, liminal space while seeking different means of exiting. Mechanically, you'll hardly do anything at all beyond waving a flashlight around and consuming found cartons of almond water to restore your ever-draining sanity meter. Sometimes, you'll need to solve environmental puzzles, like learning which playground slide you can safely head down (since most eject you in several bloody chunks). Occasionally, key items, including literal keys, must be found to progress, forcing you to repeatedly head off in search of semi-randomly placed quest items. In an early level, you'll need to rebuild a ladder to reach a key to the exit door, for example, while in another, you'll search for elevators in a darkened parking garage that would be totally empty if not for the roaming "skin-stealer" monster hidden in the shadows.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Colditz Castle: The Most Escape-Proof Nazi Prison Of WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SP12R54hzsI</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SP12R54hzsI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 27 Oct 2025 22:00:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Colditz Castle in Germany was used as a prisoner of war camp during WW2.

Medieval historian Dr Hetta Howes (author of Poet, Mystic, Widow, Wife) reacts to Guy Ritchie's King Arthur: Legend of the Sword, separating Hollywood fantasy from medieval sources. We explore the facts behind the fiction, from the opening battle's elephants to that David Beckham cameo.

We dive into the film's biggest changes: Arthur's brothel upbringing, the conflation of Excalibur with the Sword in the Stone, and the "weird snake sirens" that replace the Lady of the Lake. Dr Hetta Howes explains the real medieval stories of Uther Pendragon, Vortigern, Igraine, and the true origins of the Round Table.

But look to the data, and that story starts to fall apart. Emissions are peaking in key sectors. Clean energy is scaling faster than anyone predicted. Real progress is happening.

Sean’s guest today is Hannah Ritchie, Deputy Editor at Our World in Data and author of Clearing the Air: A Hopeful Guide to Solving Climate Change.

However, goal was to combine privacy of Vanadium with the power of desktop extensions and Helium features, and make it accessible to a wider audience. (Passkeys from Bitwarden Mobile should also work straight away once merged in the list of FIDO2 privileged browsers)Build scripts are in the repo if you want to compile it yourself. You can find pre-built releases there too.Would love any feedback/support!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Berlin 1933: Inside Hitler&apos;s First Year In Power</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bYBGW4jWg0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6bYBGW4jWg0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 22:00:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Berlin 1933, the world watched as Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party swiftly dismantled German democracy.

Last year, I got rejected after a job interview because I lacked some CPU knowledge. After that, I decided to deepen my understanding in the low level world and learn how things work under the hood. I decided to try and create an OS in C and ASM as a way to broaden my knowledge in this area.This took me on the most interesting ride, where I’ve learned about OS theory and low level programming on a whole new level.  I’ve spent hours upon hours, blood and tears, reading different OS theory blogs, learning low level concepts, debugging, testing and working on this project.This part was the longest, but also the easiest. I felt like I understood the theory, but still could not connect it into actual code. Sitting down and starting to code was difficult, but I knew that was the next step I needed to  take! 
I began by working on the bootloader, which is optional since you can use a pre-made one (I switched to GRUB later), but implementing it was mainly for learning purposes and to warm up on ASM. These were my steps after that:  1) I started implementing the VGA driver, which gave me the ability to display text.
  2) Interrupts - IDT, ISR, IRQ, which signal to the CPU that a certain event occurred and needs handling (such as faults, hardware connected device actions, etc).
  3) Keyboard driver, which enables me to display the same text I type on my keyboard.
  4) PMM (Physical memory management)
  5) Paging and virtual memory management
  6) RTC driver - clock addition (which was, in my opinion, optional)
  7) PIT driver - Ticks every certain amount of time, and also  
  8) FS (File System) and physical HDD drivers - for the HDD I chose PATA (HDD communication protocol) for simplicity (SATA is a newer but harder option as well).
     For the FS I chose EXT2 (The Second Extended FileSystem), which is a foundational linux FS structure introduced in 1993. This FS structure is not the simplest,
     but is very popular in hobby-OS, it is very supported, easy to set up and upgrade to newer EXT versions, it has a lot of materials online, compared to other
     options. This was probably the longest and largest feature I had worked on.
  9) Syscall support.
  10) Libc implementation.
  11) Processing and scheduling for multiprocessing.
  12) Here I also made a shell to test it all.

At this point, I had a working shell, but later decided to go further and add a GUI! I was working on the FS (stage 8), when I heard about Hack Club’s Summer of Making (SoM). This was my first time practicing in HackClub, and I want to express my gratitude and share my enjoyment of participating in it.At first I just wanted to declare the OS as finished after completing the FS, and a bit of other drivers, but because of SoM my perspective was changed completely. Because of the competition, I started to think that I needed to ship a complete OS, with processing, GUI and the bare minimum ability to run Doom. I wanted to show the community in SoM how everything works.Then I worked on it for another 2 months, after finishing the shell, just because of SoM!,  totalling my project to almost 7 months of work. At this time I added full GUI support, with dirty rectangles and double buffering, I made a GUI mouse driver, and even made a full Doom port! things I would've never even thought about without participating in SoM.Every project has challenges, especially in such a low level project. I had to do a lot of debugging while working on this, and it is no easy task. I highly recommend using GDB which helped me debug so many of my problems, especially memory ones.The first major challenge I encountered was during the coding of processes - I realized that a lot of my paging code was completely wrong, poorly tested, and had to be reworked. During this time I was already in the competition and it was difficult keeping up with devlogs and new features while fixing old problems in a code I wrote a few months ago.Some more major problems occurred when trying to run Doom, and unlike the last problem, this was a disaster. I had random PFs and memory problems, one run could work while the next one wouldn’t, and the worst part is that it was only on the Doom, and not on processes I created myself. These issues took a lot of time to figure out. I began to question the Doom code itself, and even thought about giving up on the whole project.After a lot of time spent debugging, I fixed the issues. It was a combination of scheduling issues, Libc issues and the Qemu not having enough (wrongfully assuming 128MB for the whole OS was enough).Finally, I worked throughout all the difficulties, and shipped the project! In the end, the experience working on this project was amazing. I learned a lot, grew and improved as a developer, and I thank SoM for helping to increase my motivation and make the project memorable and unique like I never imagined it would be.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Does Generative AI Threaten the Open Source Ecosystem?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/10/26/208204/does-generative-ai-threaten-the-open-source-ecosystem?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sun, 26 Oct 2025 20:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ "Snippets of proprietary or copyleft reciprocal code can enter AI-generated outputs, contaminating codebases with material that developers can't realistically audit or license properly." 


That's the warning from Sean O'Brien, who founded the Yale Privacy Lab at Yale Law School. ZDNet reports:



Open software has always counted on its code being regularly replenished. As part of the process of using it, users modify it to improve it. They add features and help to guarantee usability across generations of technology. At the same time, users improve security and patch holes that might put everyone at risk. But O'Brien says, "When generative AI systems ingest thousands of FOSS projects and regurgitate fragments without any provenance, the cycle of reciprocity collapses. The generated snippet appears originless, stripped of its license, author, and context." This means the developer downstream can't meaningfully comply with reciprocal licensing terms because the output cuts the human link between coder and code. Even if an engineer suspects that a block of AI-generated code originated under an open source license, there's no feasible way to identify the source project. The training data has been abstracted into billions of statistical weights, the legal equivalent of a black hole. 

The result is what O'Brien calls "license amnesia." He says, "Code floats free of its social contract and developers can't give back because they don't know where to send their contributions...." 

"Once AI training sets subsume the collective work of decades of open collaboration, the global commons idea, substantiated into repos and code all over the world, risks becoming a nonrenewable resource, mined and never replenished," says O'Brien. "The damage isn't limited to legal uncertainty. If FOSS projects can't rely upon the energy and labor of contributors to help them fix and improve their code, let alone patch security issues, fundamentally important components of the software the world relies upon are at risk." 

O'Brien says, "The commons was never just about free code. It was about freedom to build together." That freedom, and the critical infrastructure that underlies almost all of modern society, is at risk because attribution, ownership, and reciprocity are blurred when AIs siphon up everything on the Internet and launder it (the analogy of money laundering is apt), so that all that code's provenance is obscured.

Jacques-Louis David was the image-maker of revolutions, regimes, and empire. Born into a France simmering with discontent in the build up to Revolution, his life was marked by violence, ambition, and turbulence. 
He voted to execute a king, helped build the myth of a revolutionary republic, and when that republic imploded, he helped crown an emperor. Drawn repeatedly to authoritarian figures - from Robespierre and Marat to Napoleon Bonaparte - David couldn’t resist the magnetic pull of power.
His 1801 masterpiece Napoleon Crossing the Alps reveals everything about David: his obsession with power, his taste for dramatic storytelling, and how seeing is believing.
This is the story of art as propaganda.

She can no longer breathe freely. A donor organ is finally found. The film shows the beginning of her new life. Her struggle, her happiness, and her setbacks.

Ruth Bopp will never forget October 20, 2023. At 3:50 a.m., the ringing of her cell phone roused her from sleep. On the other end of the line: Hannover Medical School. The news: there was a suitable lung for her. An ambulance was already on its way.
Ruth Bopp suffered from pulmonary fibrosis, a serious chronic disease that makes breathing increasingly difficult. For years, she was dependent on an oxygen tank. After the transplant, she was able to breathe freely again just four days later - without a tube or device. "It was an indescribable feeling,” she says. "Finally being able to breathe on my own again - that was wonderful.”
But Ruth's story is an exception. In Germany, 8,400 patients are urgently waiting for a donor organ - but there are only 965 donors. The country has what’s known as an "opt-in” policy: organ or tissue donation is only possible if the deceased person has given their consent during their lifetime - or if their relatives do so retroactively. In many other European countries such as France, Spain and the Netherlands, however, an "opt-out” policy applies: anyone who does not expressly object is automatically considered a donor.
The documentary provides an insight into what life with a serious lung disease is like, and traces the path to transplantation. The film also documents the emotional power of hope. Ruth Bopp makes an urgent appeal to society: "If you need an organ yourself, you want it straight away - but very few people consider the idea of donating themselves.” Yet current surveys show a positive trend: according to a study by one medical insurance group, 49% of adults in Germany now have an organ donor card - compared to 41% in 2021.

Idealism is the theory that all reality is consciousness and only consciousness, and that what we perceive to be the physical world is either a manifestation of consciousness or derived from it. Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

Focusing on real-world scenarios, Canonical Academy aims to foster practical skills rather than theoretical knowledge. The end goal? Getting professionals ready for the actual challenges they will face on the job. The learning platform is already live with its first course offering, the System Administrator track (with three certification exams), which is tailored for anyone looking to validate their Linux and Ubuntu expertise. 

The exams use cloud-based testing environments that simulate real workplace scenarios. Each assessment is modular, meaning you can progress through individual exams and earn badges for each one. Complete all the exams in this track to earn the full Sysadmin qualification... Canonical is also looking for community members to contribute as beta testers and subject-matter experts (SME). If you are interested in helping shape the platform or want to get started with your certification, you can visit the Canonical Academy website. 

The sys-admin track offers exams for Linux Terminal, Ubuntu Desktop 2024, Ubuntu Server 2024, and "managing complex systems," according to an official FAQ. "Each exam provides an in-browser remote desktop interface into a functional Ubuntu Desktop environment running GNOME. From this initial node, you will be expected to troubleshoot, configure, install, and maintain systems, processes, and other general activities associated with managing Linux. The exam is a hybrid format featuring multiple choice, scenario-based, and performance-based questions..." 

"Test-takers interested in the types of material covered on each exam can review links to tutorials and documentation on our website." 

The FAQ advises test takers to use a Chromium-based browser, as Firefox "is NOT supported at this time... There is a known issue with keyboards and Firefox in the CUE.01 Linux 24.04 preview release at this time, which will be resolved in the CUE.01 Linux 24.10 exam release."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Driving Through India: A Game of Chicken</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/a0Myw7wCpYY</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/a0Myw7wCpYY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 25 Oct 2025 22:00:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[India and traffic: quite the combo.

Where did they come from? Were they mystical druidic people of the British Isles – or gruesome, barbarian warriors who got under Caesar’s skin? In the heart of the European Alps, remarkable evidence of a culture that thrived 3,000 years ago has been found trapped and perfectly preserved inside sealed salt mines. Inside a 2,400-year-old tomb the remains of a woman and two men have been recovered. She was an aristocrat; they were giants of men. A shaman and her entourage? Relatives or sacrifices? An interdisciplinary team of scientists is working to unlock the secret of this ancient trio, it may be the first real evidence of mystical rites from the dawn of the Celts.

Microsoft introduced a new artificial intelligence character called Mico (pronounced MEE'koh) on Thursday, a floating cartoon face shaped like a blob or flame that will embody the software giant's Copilot virtual assistant and marks the latest attempt by tech companies to imbue their AI chatbots with more of a personality... "When you talk about something sad, you can see Mico's face change. You can see it dance around and move as it gets excited with you," said Jacob Andreou, corporate vice president of product and growth for Microsoft AI, in an interview with The Associated Press. "It's in this effort of really landing this AI companion that you can really feel." 

In the U.S. only so far, Copilot users on laptops and phone apps can speak to Mico, which changes colors, spins around and wears glasses when in "study" mode. It's also easy to shut off, which is a big difference from Microsoft's Clippit, better known as Clippy and infamous for its persistence in offering advice on word processing tools when it first appeared on desktop screens in 1997. "It was not well-attuned to user needs at the time," said Bryan Reimer, a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Microsoft pushed it, we resisted it and they got rid of it. I think we're much more ready for things like that today..." 


Microsoft's product releases Thursday include a new option to invite Copilot into a group chat, an idea that resembles how AI has been integrated into social media platforms like Snapchat, where Andreou used to work, or Meta's WhatsApp and Instagram. But Andreou said those interactions have often involved bringing in AI as a joke to "troll your friends," in contrast to Microsoft's designs for an "intensely collaborative" AI-assisted workplace.

One that is deployed against men, as well as women. The enemy is not killed, but destroyed nonetheless. In this documentary, men from Ukraine, Congo and Bosnia break their silence.

Most male survivors of sexual violence remain silent. So the perpetrators get away with it. Often, the perpetrators do not even have a sense of wrongdoing when they commit these war crimes.

The first men to seek justice at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague were survivors of the Bosnian War (1992-1995). This marked a turning point.

Zihnija Bašić from Bosnia tells how he had to fight for a long time to be recognized as a war victim after his rapes. He still suffers from the abuse to this day. Oleksiy Sivak from Ukraine has since founded a self-help group. Like his friend Roman Shapovalenko, he was sexually abused by Russian occupying forces. 

Masokolo Lemba from the Congo is also a member of a self-help group. Lemba fled from the war in his home country to Uganda - where survivors of sexual violence are often accused of homosexuality, which is a punishable offense in Uganda. This stigmatization and criminalization make it difficult to cope with the trauma. 

Historian Regina Mühlhäuser is a member of an international research group that investigates sexual violence against men. She says: "If you want to prevent sexual violence against men in war-time, you have to fight it in peace-time. After all, prisons and the military are often breeding grounds for this violence."

Despite their fear of stigmatization and discrimination, the survivors in this film have chosen to tell their stories in order to bring this taboo topic to light.

Neil deGrasse Tyson, Chuck Nice, and Gary 
O’Reilly sit down with neuroscientist Ben Rein, author of Why Brains Need Friends: The Science of Social Connection, to explore how the loneliness epidemic impacts our minds, bodies, and even our lifespan.

What’s the difference between being alone and being lonely? Why can you be surrounded by people and still feel alone? We breaks down the neurobiology behind social connection, how oxytocin, serotonin, and dopamine reward our interactions, and what happens when we’re missing those signals. From rising cortisol levels to chronic inflammation, we learn how prolonged loneliness can actually damage organs and shorten lives.

Do extroverts live longer? How much social time is “enough”? We dig into personality, empathy, and why virtual interactions often leave us unsatisfied. Could our brains be losing their ability to read social cues online—and is that fueling the hostility of the internet age?

Can we medicate loneliness away? How do drugs like MDMA affect empathy? We get into why oxytocin is nature’s antidepressant, and how our pets might literally make us healthier. We get into research on what makes for good socializing and how loneliness leads to more loneliness. How do we dig ourselves out?

Network intelligence company Ookla said its DownDetector service received more than 17 million reports of disrupted services offered by 3,500 organizations. The three biggest countries where reports originated were the US, the UK, and Germany. Snapchat, AWS, and Roblox were the most reported services affected. Ookla said the event was “among the largest internet outages on record for Downdetector.”Amazon said the root cause of the outage was a software bug in software running the DynamoDB DNS management system. The system monitors the stability of load balancers by, among other things, periodically creating new DNS configurations for endpoints within the AWS network.

For years, the Envoy community has eagerly awaited support for dynamic modules as an extension mechanism – a feature that remained unaddressed until recently. A dynamic module is a shared library that can be loaded by Envoy at runtime, offering an alternative to existing extension mechanisms like Lua, External Processing, or Wasm.

Our early benchmark results in a production environment demonstrate that dynamic modules perform almost identically to native C++ extensions, which was nearly impossible before. Developing native C++ extensions requires rebuilding the Envoy binary and entails significant maintenance. In contrast, dynamic modules can be developed in almost any programming language, hence greatly benefits vendors and end users who require performance-sensitive custom business logic with the minimum maintenance.

In this talk, as the maintainer of dynamic module support in Envoy, I will provide an overview of this feature, share recent updates, and discuss future developments.

Operating Envoy at production scale, we faced overwhelming telemetry costs and degraded performance as logging volume grew exponentially. Traditional approaches to observability were consuming 40% of our infrastructure budget while actually reducing system throughput due to resource contention.

In this talk we demonstrates our approach to strategic logging and telemetry optimizations by implementing intelligent filtering, sampling strategies, and selective metric collection that maintained full operational visibility while significantly reducing the overhead.

We achieved about 65% reduction in logging infrastructure costs and 60% improvement in overall throughput, while maintaining 99.9% uptime and improving our mean time to resolution for incidents from hours to minutes.

We'll also talk about various contributions we have made to the OSS Envoy for improving the observability and the future on how at Databricks we are using Access Logging Service to integrate our internal systems.

The Generative AI boom has created a new kind of technical debt: a chaotic tangle of API keys, unpredictable costs from token-based billing, and inconsistent security. How do we move from this chaos to a managed, secure, and cost-effective AI strategy?

This session introduces the Envoy AI Gateway, a recent open-source CNCF project designed to be the central control plane for your GenAI traffic. Learn how it provides a unified API to abstract away the differences between various AI/LLM providers, enabling seamless model switching.

Join us for a practical introduction and see demos of the essential features: enforcing token-based rate limiting to control costs, centralizing credential management to enhance security, and gaining crucial observability into your organization's AI usage.

What would it mean for God to be more than one person? ‘Three persons in one God’ is the Christian claim, and in what sense can ‘one God consisting of three persons’ even make sense? What would be the theology of multiple persons as God? Why three persons in the Godhead? What’s the difference between polytheism, many gods, and multiple persons in the same God?

Zombies hasn't attracted more imitators. The charming and intuitive strategy game helped make a name for PopCap and spawned a massive franchise including merch, comic books, and interestingly, more competitive team shooters than strategy games. But while it lends itself to comparisons to tower-defense games, its key mechanics are still basically singular to PvZ itself. Plants Vs. Zombies: Replanted brings a nicely modernized facelift to the original game, and while this remaster offers only a few new frills, the game itself is still one of a kind.For those new to the series, or who have only played the Garden Warfare spin-offs, the core idea of Plants Vs. Zombies is deceptively simple. You're the owner of a house beset by a zombie apocalypse, and your only defense is an army of living plants. You collect sunlight to power your seeds, which you plant across five horizontal rows as zombies approach from the right side. You can plant Sunflowers to generate extra sunlight, and you're constantly juggling priorities as zombies approach from the other lanes. If they reach your plants, they'll chomp down on them and you'll have to replant them, so it's best to keep them from reaching that far at all. As the game continues, it constantly adds new wrinkles, like nighttime levels where you have less access to sunlight and need to rely on fungi, or a pool where you need to plant lilypads for your other offensive plants to sit on. This is alongside a steady stream of new zombie types that demand different configurations of plant defenses.And the zombies themselves, in this case, are far from threatening. They're goofy and often even kind of cute, with cartoonish affectations like a propeller hat or a disco outfit to signify which type of zombie they are. A zombie with a cone or metal bucket on its head will take more hits before you can knock the cone off and finish it off, a football zombie has heavy defense and also charges more quickly at you, and so on.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Fragile Israel-Hamas Cease-Fire: Two Families’ Search for Remains | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6xpF_HljU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/dZ6xpF_HljU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 18:53:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The bodies of Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza are at the center of a fragile cease-fire between Israel and Hamas.

The AI boom isn’t just about algorithms — it’s about money, power, and a race to build infrastructure on a scale we’ve never seen before. In this video, we break down the circular deals between OpenAI, Nvidia, Amazon, Anthropic, and even Elon Musk’s empire — and ask the hard questions: Who’s paying for this? Where will the electricity come from? And is the industry building a Möbius strip of venture capital and gigawatts that could collapse under its own weight?
We’ll explore:

The spaghetti diagram of AI’s biggest players
OpenAI’s trillion-dollar data center ambitions
Why Nvidia’s demand might not be what it seems
The risk of stranded assets and systemic leverage
How geopolitics and energy constraints could shape the future

If you want to understand the economics behind the hype — and why this might be the biggest corporate investment project in history — watch now.

If consciousness is 100% physical, we would have to conclude that the same kind of consciousness that we experience as humans can be generated by non-biological entities (eventually). Conversely, if non-biological consciousness would somehow, someday, prove impossible, then consciousness would have to embed some nonphysical aspect. But how would we ever know?

But an increasing number are breaking the silence and fighting for respect and their rights – with words, music and physical strength. Activist Usha Vishwakarma trains women in the art of self-defense. Many members of her “Red Brigade” have themselves suffered sexual violence. Rapper JQueen channels her anger into powerful rap songs as a solo artist or with her all-female band “Wild Wild Women.” And student Sheshandeep Kaur Sidhu campaigns to get more women to enter politics. They all represent a new generation pushing back against traditional gender roles. They demand respect and personal safety despite structural barriers and societal expectations. Their resistance shows that change begins at the point where women empower themselves.

(I’ve wanted to write about stacked diffs anyway.)Share & I'll send you some rewards for the referrals.What Is a Stacked Diff? (The Simple Answer)Stacked diffs are a type of code review workflow.Imagine you’re building a house with LEGO. Instead of assembling the whole thing at once, you build it layer by layer.First, you assemble the foundation. Then you add the walls, roof, and so on. Each part builds on the one before it. You can keep adding new LEGO layers while the lower ones are still being checked by someone.Stacked diffs work the same way for code. Instead of making one big change all at once, you create a set of small changes, each built on the previous one. The reviewer can check each change on its own while you keep working on the rest.This makes your work easier to review, understand, and improve.Let’s Start With the Pull Request WorkflowWhat’s a pull request workflow? Think of it as asking someone to review your code before merging into the main branch. This increases the code quality.Commit my code changes to that branchOpen a pull request for reviewAfter approval, I merge onto the main branchSee how each feature branch becomes a UNIT of code review? That’s pull request workflow!Put simply, a pull request is a branch with many commits. And every pull request represents a feature.So Why Do We Need Stacked Diffs?Although the pull request workflow is simple, it slows you down:You wait for code reviews on big pull requests, which can stall progress.Waste time by switching between branches for unrelated tasks. (Even if changes don’t conflict.)Rebase endlessly on dependent pull requests when changes are being made during review.Plus, squashing big pull requests can lower the commit history quality with vague commits. Thus making code maintenance difficult.Besides engineers take the shortest path possible.With a pull request workflow, putting unrelated changes into a big pull request is easier. And this creates a low-quality commit history.But with stacked diffs, by default, you make small changes. This makes reviews easier and code quality better.Real-World Example: New FeatureWith stacked diffs, the UNIT of review isn’t a branch, but a single commit.Imagine you’re developing a new feature.Instead of one big pull request with 1000 lines of code, you break it down into smaller diffs:Boilerplate code → 500 linesBusiness logic → 350 linesAdd boilerplate code in the first diff.Request a review for that diff.Add business logic in the next diff.Submit that diff too for review.Then add edge cases as another diff.Submit that diff as well for review.Merge each diff independently as feedback comes in.Each diff builds on top of the previous one, but they can all be reviewed in parallel. Plus, you can assign different reviewers for each diff. So you don’t have to wait for one to merge before continuing to work on the next.Yet each commit must build successfully and pass tests. Otherwise, the codebase becomes unstable.How Do “Stacked Diffs” Work?Think of stacked diffs like building a LEGO house layer by layer.Each layer depends on the shape of the one below. So if you change a lower layer, you’ll need to adjust the ones above to fit. And the house is complete only after you assemble all layers in the correct order.Stacked diffs work the same way for code.Instead of one big pull request, you create a set of small changes that depend on each other. Here’s a simple comparison:Small pull requests (diff) → LEGO layersBoilerplate code → foundationSo if you edit an earlier diff to address feedback, you’ll need to rebase the latest diffs that depend on it. Otherwise, it’ll reference the old version of that commit and won’t apply cleanly on top of the new version. Put simply, there’ll be conflicts.How Do We Handle These Stacked Diffs?Stacked diffs improve engineers’ productivity. But it can be painful when diffs depend on each other.Imagine diff1 needs many changes after review.Now, you must also update diff2 and diff3, which depend on diff1, to include those new changes.To do this, you’ve got to use git rebase, which replays your commits so everything aligns correctly.But if the new version of diff1 conflicts with diff2, then you’ll need to pick manually which parts of the code to keep.And this could turn into a time sink!So we need an automation tool for this - . It makes the workflow easier by:Hiding Git complexity from engineers.Tracking GitHub pull requests related to each diff.Saving the order of diffs in the stack (which depends on what).Automatically rebasing all dependent diffs if something changes on an earlier diff.Inserting a diff between existing diffs. Or changing the order of diffs without manual work.Think of Graphite like Git on steroids to work with stacked diffs. It removes the manual work of rebasing and merging and maximizes engineering productivity.But even with Graphite handling stacks and rebases, reviews still take time. You’ve got to explain changes, address feedback, and update pull requests.It’s a unified AI reviewer that explains what changed, suggests fixes, and updates your pull requests in real time (without switching between tools).Apply or generate fixes instantlyMerge confidently with full contextAsk questions about your code directly in the pull requestTogether, Graphite and Graphite Agent automate both sides of the workflow: the Git and review side. So you can write, review, and merge faster with less context switching.Stacked Diffs: Real Applications You Use DailyInstead of making a big code change, break it into smaller diffs.Each diff adds part of the functionality, making it easier to review and test.You can keep working on the next part without waiting for the earlier parts to be merged.Break large refactoring into logical chunks.For example, create a diff to add a new interface. Then use separate diffs to refactor different modules.This keeps each diff focused and easy to test and review.Some updates, such as renaming an API, touch many files.And you can update each component in separate diffs.This reduces the chance of mistakes during reviews.You can put code changes and tests in separate diffs.This keeps diffs smaller and makes reviews easier.Imagine you discover a bug while a feature is still under review.You don’t have to update existing changes; instead, create a new diff on top of the current stack to fix the bug.This approach increases code review velocity and lets you stay unblocked.Also stacked diffs let you manage big pull requests with AI-GENERATED code by breaking them into smaller changes.Why Not Just Use Pull Request Workflow?It’s sometimes acceptable to open many pull requests and wait for code review.Yet it doesn’t work well when pull requests depend on one another. You’re then blocked on the dependent pull request until someone reviews the first pull request.Plus, the local repository has to look similar to the remote. It means more context switching and less productivity. So the pull request workflow is inefficient.Easy to write code. Easy to review. Easy to revert.You can choose how to organize work for flexibility.And protect your coding streaks for higher productivity.Keep the Git history quality high and make debugging easier.Both workflows are productive. Yet stacked diffs make development faster by adapting to how the engineer actually works. It doesn’t force an inflexible workflow.Remember, context switching is the worst productivity killer for engineers. Stacked diffs reduce it, while the pull request workflow amplifies it.Stacked Diffs With Graphite (Simplified)Switch to the main branch and pull the latest changes.Use Graphite’s CLI to create a new branch for the first part (diff) of the feature.Create new branches on top of the previous branches for each part of the feature.Push each branch to the remote and open a pull request for that diff. (Graphite can even submit the entire stack of branches as separate pull requests with a single command.)Update the diff after review. Then Graphite will AUTOMATICALLY rebase the remaining branches if you changed a lower diff.Merge each diff’s pull request into the main branch once approved.Graphite can even delete the merged feature branches and update your local main branch.Imagine Graphite as a super smart partner who understands what adjustments to make for maximum productivity. And think of Graphite Agent as a team member who reviews your code in real time, explaining and fixing as you go.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 180,001+ readers strong, very close to 181k.

To what extent are Russian interests present within American foreign policy? And - could there be a connection between the answers to these two questions?

US President Donald Trump has had ties to Russia for decades. In this documentary, former KGB, FBI and CIA employees offer insights into the world of espionage, the Cold War and Trump's extensive network of connections to Russia.

During the Cold War, numerous Russian agents infiltrated a variety of political and economic organizations in the US. In addition to industrial espionage, the missions also focused on establishing relationships with influential political figures.

Trump's ties to Russia date back to this period. In 1987, he traveled to Moscow with his then-wife, Ivana, to negotiate a deal to build a luxury hotel there. Semion Mogilevich, head of the Russian mafia, was one of the first investors in New York's Trump Tower. While campaigning for president in 2016, Donald Trump was simultaneously pursuing plans to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. 

Investigations into possible Kremlin interference in the presidential election reveal that more than a dozen members of the Republican campaign team had ties to Russia. And the war against Ukraine further complicates the situation: Russian President Vladimir Putin would have a keen interest in an ally who could weaken Ukraine and help him win.

--

In 2018, a nonprofit gave every adult in the Ahenyo village $500. Most families had lived in extreme poverty for generations, and this sum was roughly equivalent to their annual salaries. The money came with no strings attached to how it could be spent. Would this lift villagers out of poverty or be another failed philanthropic endeavor? Explore aid programs and how they address people's needs.

It’s an idea that runs counter to the materialist worldview we’re all taught in school. But the outer edges of scientific inquiry bleed into what can only be called ‘magic.’ With a uniquely science-backed approach, parapsychologist Dean Radin explores the "magical" elements of consciousness including telepathy, spell casting, conjuring spirits, and more.

Radin's book, "The Science of Magic: How the Mind Weaves the Fabric of Reality", is on sale now: https://amzn.to/3KXvPd7

Dean Radin is an American parapsychologist. Following a bachelor and master's degree in electrical engineering and a PhD in educational psychology Radin worked at Bell Labs, as a researcher at Princeton University and the University of Edinburgh, and was a faculty member at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

The spacefaring retro-future was recognizable as a continuation of Obsidian's earlier game, though it had enough of a distinct setting and its own gameplay systems to feel fresh. The Outer Worlds 2 builds on that sturdy foundation, and while it's largely more of the same, it is also a confident and expansive sequel that suggests a bright future for The Outer Worlds as an ongoing series.In Outer Worlds 2, you play as "the Commander." Whereas the first game had you play as a random colonist, this new role inherently imbues you with more authority as an Earth Directorate agent. In short, you're a fixer, dispatched to the Arcadia region that's being ripped apart by a factional war, corporate takeovers, and the emergence of rifts that have been cutting the colony off from communications with Earth. From the very beginning, you have your badge and gun, so to speak, along with your own fledgling crew and a spaceship base of operations called the Incognito. Of course, your very first mission goes terribly wrong (as these things tend to) and when you regain consciousness some time later, you set out to find the persons responsible for the botched mission, while also investigating the increasingly dire rift problem. Without getting into spoilers, it's a strong opening that propels the story forward with momentum and mystery.When you're creating your Commander, you can select a number of different backgrounds like a disgraced gambler, a disgraced professor, a disgraced freelancer, or an ex-convict. You get the sense that most people become agents in the space FBI for lack of other options, except for the Lawbringer background, which is pure and straightforward Lawful Good. I chose Roustabout, which is a friendly way of saying "disgraced idiot."Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fundamentals of DevOps &amp; Software Delivery • Yevgeniy &quot;Jim&quot; Brikman &amp; Kief Morris • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zyz_2lELqG8</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zyz_2lELqG8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 12:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club. #GOTOcon #GOTObookclub

DESCRIPTION
Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman, author of "Fundamentals of DevOps and Software Delivery", discusses his journey from app developer to DevOps advocate, triggered by LinkedIn's deployment crisis that required freezing all product development for months. The discussion with Kief Morris explores the practical definition of DevOps as efficient software delivery methodology, the relationship between infrastructure as code and application orchestration tools, the necessity of frameworks over custom wrapper scripts, and emerging paradigms including infrastructure from code, infrastructure as graph models, and interactive runbooks.

Jim emphasizes that while new approaches are interesting, maturity and standardization in existing tools often provides more value than constantly chasing new technologies.

The rise of AI agents has amplified this complexity by adding new demands around permission controls, environment isolation, and resource management.Ona is a platform for AI-native software development and engineering agents. The platform combines autonomous agents with secure, standardized environments, with a focus on giving enterprises control, security, and productivity so they can scale AI-native engineering without scaling risk.Chris Weichel has more than two decades of experience spanning software engineering and human–computer interaction. He is currently the Chief Technology Officer at Ona – formerly Gitpod – where he leads the engineering team behind the company’s cloud-native development platform. Chris joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to talk about Ona, the impact of coding with parallel agents, the future of IDEs, choosing agent-friendly languages, code review as a new bottleneck in the software development lifecycle, and much more.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Ona formerly Gitpod.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders.

What he meant by this, though, was that while the Katamari series has never quite reached a point of true, mainstream popularity, it's certainly managed to foster a cult following of fans who adore its peculiarity--fans who revel in absurd concepts like "rolling up the world," and seemingly always have some niche-yet-utterly-engrossing New Thing to show you. A fanbase of "cool uncles," if you will.Though I can't claim to be an uncle and certainly won't claim to be cool, after playing Once Upon a Katamari, I am eager and ready to join their ranks. The newest entry in Bandai Namco's nonsensical action-puzzle series has converted me from a Katamari appreciator to a Katamari fan. Once Upon a Katamari is a joyous return for the long-stagnant series, bringing with it small tweaks that make moment-to-moment gameplay more fun and lead to a number of clever levels. A tighter narrative, more engaging overworld, customization features, and updated visuals help set the game apart from its predecessors, while its playful writing and whimsical nature retain that distinctly Katamari feel. While Once Upon a Katamari might stumble a bit when it comes to innovating, the end result is a highly polished (and fun) new entry in the Katamari series.Once Upon a Katamari kicks off the way these things so often do: with our beloved King of the Cosmos doing something tremendously stupid. During one of the royal family's much-needed cleaning days, the King of the Cosmos stumbles upon a peculiar scroll. What ensues is an embarrassingly relatable sequence of events, as the king grows distracted by the scroll, decides he'd rather be doing literally other than cleaning, and ultimately ends up hurling the object into space after using it as a baton. Naturally, this action winds up destroying the entirety of the cosmos, prompting the king to recruit you, The Prince, to help fix this even larger mess.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Have We Really Found Life on Mars?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNix0UImPpo</link><author>Astrum</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uNix0UImPpo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 16:01:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9b7aDP6ZN0coj9-xFnrtw">Astrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You’ve seen the headlines: NASA has discovered the first signs of life on Mars.

It permeates the air, soil, and even our bodies. The problem is getting worse, and yet the plastics industry is increasing production.

Environmental lawyer Steven Feit reveals that plastics are the petroleum industry’s growth strategy in the 21st century, even as the world moves away from fossil fuels as an energy source. Sarah Jeanne Royer, an oceanographer, shows the damage microplastics are doing to the coasts of Hawaii. Sharon Lavigne, a retired teacher, fights against pollution and environmental racism in her city, which is home to some of the largest plastic production facilities in the US. The film also follows a photojournalist raising awareness about the problems being caused by single-use plastics in his native Kenya, and lobbyists who aim to convince the industry’s critics that new recycling technologies will make a difference. And one Hamburg-based chemist and inventor has suggestions for how we could solve the world’s plastics problem once and for all.

Is the plastics industry listening? Can people trust it to take responsibility for plastic products after the end of their life cycle? And what solutions are there in a world that is increasingly choking on plastic?

He stressed that when we do anything, we should commit to it fully, giving it our undivided attention and allowing ourselves to become immersed in it, be it simply eating, walking, or anything else. "Drink your tea slowly and reverently," he said, "as if it is the axis on which the earth revolves--slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future."Like its predecessor, PowerWash Simulator 2 is a stage on which one can play out Thich Nhat Hanh's message. The simple pleasures of washing away the grime from dozens of walls, floors, cars, and couches act like an on-ramp to a flow state. For a while, I let the sequel wash over me, giving it my entire being and enjoying it thoroughly. But long before I sprayed away the last patch of mildew, I was back to my old ways, multitasking my way through a game that asks of me more patience and attention than I was willing to give it.PowerWash Simulator 2 is exactly what it sounds like, though if you haven't played the first game, its title alone may not make it apparent why it can be so much fun. In this first-person job sim from FuturLab, you'll live out a career as a powerwasher, taking on nearly 40 jobs in solo play, split-screen, or online multiplayer with other soapy experts. You'll begin with a few simple tools--hoses with different nozzles that provide a range of spraying intensities and patterns, almost like an arsenal of guns in a traditional shooter. In essence, this a shooter, but rather than zombies or Nazis, your targets are buildings, furnishings, and vehicles absolutely blanketed in filth, with each mission ending when you've completely cleansed the area of its grime.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Embracing Complexity in Serverless • Sheen Brisals • GOTO 2025</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zms-iepcLpw</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zms-iepcLpw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 22 Oct 2025 12:01:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This presentation was recorded at GOTO Serverless 2025. #GOTOcon #GOTOserverless

ABSTRACT
As humans, we manage the most complex system in the world: our bodies. As engineers and technicians, we have been building and operating some of the most complex systems on Earth and beyond for centuries. However, when we encounter modern cloud applications that serve us in our daily lives, we often find ourselves complaining that they are complicated. We label the communication lines in distributed systems as complex.

Why is that? Are we losing our ingenuity in dealing with modern applications?

This talk will explore the complexities of modern systems and help you understand the various types of complexity, both beneficial and detrimental. It will also provide strategies for effectively managing complexity while building cloud and serverless applications. By learning how to embrace complexity, you will be better equipped to grow your business beyond barriers! [...]

Kennedy Jr., the scion of a storied dynasty, endured tragedy and scandal, broke with the Democratic Party and his family, stoked conspiracy theories, and is reshaping government and public health.

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

“The Rise of RFK Jr.”offers a powerful portrait of how President Donald Trump’s Secretary of Health and Human Services became who he is today — starting with his childhood in the public eye as a nephew of John F. Kennedy and son of Robert F. Kennedy.

The two-hour documentary draws on rich archival footage and two dozen interviews that include Kennedy’s lifelong friends, his cousin, top political advisors, close allies in the anti-vaccine movement, scientists he has clashed with, and some he has pushed out of the government. The film is a revelatory examination of Kennedy’s life — his darkest moments, his triumphs, and the influence he’s now exerting as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.

“If he continues in the current approach, it will make decisions to get vaccinated more difficult. As you see an erosion of people’s trust, you’ll see the numbers of people getting vaccinated going down, and you’ll start to see the numbers of illnesses coming back up,” says Dr. Daniel Jernigan, one of several top CDC officials who resigned under Kennedy and speaks out in the film. “And that’s an awful thing to think about in a country that has put so much into protecting Americans with vaccines so far.”

But Kennedy’s die-hard supporters, especially from the anti-vaccine movement, insist he is bringing welcome changes to America’s health system.  

“He’s trying to triage the worst health situation this country has ever found itself in,” says Del Bigtree, a podcaster, vaccine critic and a close friend of Kennedy. “You don’t have time to have disagreement around you. Get someone in here who agrees with where we’re going, and let’s do this.” 

Timely and gripping, “The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a must-watch documentary on one of the most prominent and controversial people in U.S. politics right now, and his impact on the country. 

“The Rise of RFK Jr.” is a FRONTLINE production with Kirk Documentary Group, Ltd. The director is Michael Kirk. The writers are Michael Kirk and Mike Wiser. The producers are Michael Kirk, Mike Wiser, Vanessa Fica and Elliott Choi. The reporters are Vanessa Fica and Brooke Nelson Alexander.

BREAKING the DEADLOCK: Truth Under Fire is a provocative and gripping episode, that explores how disinformation spreads, how public perception shifts, and what’s at stake when facts are replaced by viral fiction.  

Ultimately, it challenges us to consider our responsibility to one another: that without a shared commitment to truth, our hopes for connection, community, and democracy begin to unravel.

Shortly after publication, JetBrains posted a separate statement asserting that "PHP remains a stable, professional, and evolving ecosystem." The company offered no explanation for the apparent contradiction, The Register reports. 

The survey's methodology involves weighting responses to account for bias toward JetBrains users and regional distribution factors. The company acknowledges some bias likely remains since its own customers are more inclined to respond.

"Among other things, it also powers the desktop mode of the Steam Deck gaming handheld. The KDE community today announced the latest release: Plasma 6.5." From the announcement: This fresh new release is all about fine-tuning, fresh features, and a making everything smooth and sleek for everyone. The new version brings automatic light-to-dark theme switching based on the time of day. You can configure which global themes it switches between. You can also configure whether you want the wallpaper to switch between its light and dark versions based on the color scheme, the time of day, or be always light or dark.
 
Next up is a "Pinned clipboard items" feature, which lets you save text you use regularly into the clipboard. Breeze-themed windows will now have the same level of roundness in all four corners, even the bottom one. Flatpak Permissions page has been transformed into a general Application Permissions page, where you can configure applications' ability to do things like take screenshots and accept remote control requests. The utility that reads the level of ink or toner from your printer now informs you when it's running low or empty.
 
For the gamers out there, you can now see more relevant info about game controllers on System Settings' Game Controller page. Artists among you can now configure any rotary dials and touch rings on your drawing tablet. Users sensitive to color can now make use of a grayscale color filter, which desaturates or removes color systemwide.
 
Plasma 6.5 implements support for an experimental version of the Wayland picture-in-picture protocol that promises to allow apps like Firefox to eventually display proper PiP windows that stay above others automatically. Support for "overlay planes" was added, which can reduce CPU usage and power draw when displaying full-screen content using a compatible GPU. You can read more about these and many other new features in the Plasma 6.5 release announcement and complete changelog.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How viral ICE videos are dividing — and shaping — reality #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bXVDhFVpirA</link><author>Vox</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bXVDhFVpirA?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 19:12:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA">Vox</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[There’s a growing number of viral videos showing federal agents — usually from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency and US Border Patrol — using force and aggression to control crowds, disperse protesters, and seize immigrants.

Several yachts were so badly damaged that they sank. But what’s behind the animals’ behavior?

Orcas, also known as killer whales, compete with fishers around the globe for tuna. Until five years ago, there had never been any reports of attacks on boats. But since then, there have been repeated reports of the creatures ramming yachts, particularly in summer and spring. The orcas mostly target the rudders of the sailboats. The main focal point of the "interactions,” as marine biologists refer to them, occur in the Strait of Gibraltar and off Portugal’s Atlantic Coast. Fishers, residents, whale watchers and researchers are puzzled by their sudden aggressive behavior. 
Various theories have been put forward. Some think it might be linked to competition over tuna, which migrate from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean to spawn in May before returning in July. Others suspect that it is some kind of revenge action for past injuries incurred. An older female, the leader of an orca pod, allegedly had bad experiences with boats and is teaching pod members to fight back. Many marine biologists believe it is just a kind of game. What is certain is that no one has actually been seriously hurt up to now — not even on the yachts that sank, which begs the question: Are humans even the main target?

--

Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia for over three decades, used strategic dalliances, military might, and cutting-edge philosophy to modernize, expand, and transform the Russian Empire. But was she a dedicated ruler determined to move Russia into the future, or a ruthless monarch who oppressed anyone who questioned her? Carolyn Harris puts this controversial figure on trial.

DESCRIPTION
Liz and Lesley explore the evolution of platform engineering from its DevOps and SRE roots. They discuss the challenges of building effective developer platforms, the importance of psychological safety and evidence-based prioritization, the complexities of open source sustainability, and the delicate balance between centralized platform teams and developer autonomy.

The conversation covers practical insights on documentation automation, onboarding strategies, the manager-engineer career pendulum, and why treating platform work as a service rather than a mandate is crucial for organizational success.

As rapid combos transition into powerful Izuna Drops, Guillotine Throws, and charged-up Ultimate Techniques, I deflect and counter incoming attacks, lop off numerous limbs, and spill gallons of blood in the most exhilarating and stylish way imaginable. Co-developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, Ninja Gaiden 4 revives the character-action staple by nailing the fundamentals of the series' high-octane combat and then iterating on it in a number of interesting and exciting ways. It feels distinctly like Team Ninja's Ninja Gaiden, but Platinum's DNA is also undeniably present, making for a thrilling sequel that's well worth the decade-long wait.Set in a near-future Tokyo, the once bustling city now lies deserted, blanketed by a perpetual downpour of miasma caused by the skeletal husk of the Dark Dragon looming over it. Ryu might've defeated the Divine Dragon God before, but peace can't be achieved until this cursed rain is stopped, kicking off a quest to resurrect the Dark Dragon and defeat it once and for all. For the majority of this adventure, you play as a new protagonist named Yakumo, a young ninja from the shadowy Raven Clan. He's stoic and broody, and emotes far more than Ryu ever has, but like the rest of the series, Ninja Gaiden 4 struggles to tell a compelling story.Yakumo has a team in his ear, adding some texture during moments of downtime as they chat about the state of the world and establish the stakes. This offers a new perspective on the world of ninja clans, but they're a one-dimensional bunch, and the narrative is still relatively light. Yakumo and Ryu are at odds with one another, despite ostensibly sharing the same goal, but this thread is paper-thin, and Ryu's section is disappointingly inconsequential. There are some pacing issues, too, including a stretch where the story grinds to a halt for three chapters as you chase after an interdimensional shark. It's not unexpected, but Ninja Gaiden 4 tells the sort of tale you'll likely forget about once the final credits have rolled.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>NSO permanently barred from targeting WhatsApp users with Pegasus spyware</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/nso-permanently-barred-from-targeting-whatsapp-users-with-pegasus-spyware/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/whatsapp-1024x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 22:18:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A federal judge has ordered spyware maker NSO to stop using its Pegasus app to target or infect users of WhatsApp.The ruling, issued Friday by Phyllis J.

Legal equality for all genders has still not been officially added to the Constitution. Ratified chronicles the campaign to make Virginia the 38th state to ratify the amendment, which is the number of states required to have an amendment added to the Constitution after Congressional approval. 

Despite some strides, disparities remain in pay, healthcare, and legal protections. The ERA would embed protection from gender-based discrimination and enshrine bodily autonomy in the Constitution. Follow a cross-generational, cross-party movement, led by Black women and fueled by grassroots power, to push the ERA over the finish line and into the Constitution.

The film follows organizing efforts as a cross-party coalition confronts entrenched political power. Virginia Senator Jennifer McClellan and Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy push through legislative barriers, along with a grassroots team led by Republican-turned-organizer Kati Hornung. Their efforts mark the continuum of a 101-year fight.

She was given a Lithuanian name and forbidden from speaking German.

The end of World War Two changed not only the borders, but also countless lives—like Luise’s. She was one of hundreds of what now referred to as 'wolf children,' who fought to survive without their parents, all alone in East Prussia and the Baltics. The mass exodus from East Prussia deeply affected children. In northern East Prussia, around Königsberg, tens of thousands of people died from disease and malnutrition. Often, the children were left behind. But without their parents, any relatives, or homes, they were had to fend for themselves. Many fled from impending starvation by crossing into neighboring Lithuania, where they begged or worked for bread and other bare necessities. For decades, their stories went unrecognized. They were too young to be considered directly complicit, but just German enough to be blamed for the crimes of the Nazi regime.

When I first started dabbling with container orchestration, I made more than my fair share of mistakes enough to compile a whole list of pitfalls. In this post, I want to walk through seven big gotchas I’ve encountered (or seen others run into) and share some tips on how to avoid them. Whether you’re just kicking the tires on Kubernetes or already managing production clusters, I hope these insights help you steer clear of a little extra stress.1. Skipping resource requests and limits: Not specifying CPU and memory requirements in Pod specifications. This typically happens because Kubernetes does not require these fields, and workloads can often start and run without them—making the omission easy to overlook in early configurations or during rapid deployment cycles.:
In Kubernetes, resource requests and limits are critical for efficient cluster management. Resource requests ensure that the scheduler reserves the appropriate amount of CPU and memory for each pod, guaranteeing that it has the necessary resources to operate. Resource limits cap the amount of CPU and memory a pod can use, preventing any single pod from consuming excessive resources and potentially starving other pods.
When resource requests and limits are not set:Resource Starvation: Pods may get insufficient resources, leading to degraded performance or failures. This is because Kubernetes schedules pods based on these requests. Without them, the scheduler might place too many pods on a single node, leading to resource contention and performance bottlenecks.Resource Hoarding: Conversely, without limits, a pod might consume more than its fair share of resources, impacting the performance and stability of other pods on the same node. This can lead to issues such as other pods getting evicted or killed by the Out-Of-Memory (OOM) killer due to lack of available memory.Start with modest  (for example  CPU,  memory) and see how your app behaves.Monitor real-world usage and refine your values; the HorizontalPodAutoscaler can help automate scaling based on metrics.Keep an eye on  or your logging/monitoring tool to confirm you’re not over- or under-provisioning.: Early on, I never thought about memory limits. Things seemed fine on my local cluster. Then, on a larger environment, Pods got  left and right. Lesson learned.
For detailed instructions on configuring resource requests and limits for your containers, please refer to Assign Memory Resources to Containers and Pods
(part of the official Kubernetes documentation).2. Underestimating liveness and readiness probes: Deploying containers without explicitly defining how Kubernetes should check their health or readiness. This tends to happen because Kubernetes will consider a container “running” as long as the process inside hasn’t exited. Without additional signals, Kubernetes assumes the workload is functioning—even if the application inside is unresponsive, initializing, or stuck.:
Liveness, readiness, and startup probes are mechanisms Kubernetes uses to monitor container health and availability. determine if the application is still alive. If a liveness check fails, the container is restarted. control whether a container is ready to serve traffic. Until the readiness probe passes, the container is removed from Service endpoints. help distinguish between long startup times and actual failures.Add a simple HTTP  to check a health endpoint (for example ) so Kubernetes can restart a hung container.Use a  to ensure traffic doesn’t reach your app until it’s warmed up.Keep probes simple. Overly complex checks can create false alarms and unnecessary restarts.: I once forgot a readiness probe for a web service that took a while to load. Users hit it prematurely, got weird timeouts, and I spent hours scratching my head. A 3-line readiness probe would have saved the day.3. “We’ll just look at container logs” (famous last words): Relying solely on container logs retrieved via . This often happens because the command is quick and convenient, and in many setups, logs appear accessible during development or early troubleshooting. However,  only retrieves logs from currently running or recently terminated containers, and those logs are stored on the node’s local disk. As soon as the container is deleted, evicted, or the node is restarted, the log files may be rotated out or permanently lost. using CNCF tools like Fluentd or Fluent Bit to aggregate output from all Pods. for a unified view of logs, metrics, and (if needed) traces. This lets you spot correlations between infrastructure events and app-level behavior.Pair logs with Prometheus metrics to track cluster-level data alongside application logs. If you need distributed tracing, consider CNCF projects like Jaeger.: The first time I lost Pod logs to a quick restart, I realized how flimsy “kubectl logs” can be on its own. Since then, I’ve set up a proper pipeline for every cluster to avoid missing vital clues.4. Treating dev and prod exactly the same: Deploying the same Kubernetes manifests with identical settings across development, staging, and production environments. This often occurs when teams aim for consistency and reuse, but overlook that environment-specific factors—such as traffic patterns, resource availability, scaling needs, or access control—can differ significantly. Without customization, configurations optimized for one environment may cause instability, poor performance, or security gaps in another.Use environment overlays or kustomize to maintain a shared base while customizing resource requests, replicas, or config for each environment.Extract environment-specific configuration into ConfigMaps and / or Secrets. You can use a specialized tool such as Sealed Secrets to manage confidential data.Plan for scale in production. Your dev cluster can probably get away with minimal CPU/memory, but prod might need significantly more.: One time, I scaled up  from 2 to 10 in a tiny dev environment just to “test.” I promptly ran out of resources and spent half a day cleaning up the aftermath. Oops.5. Leaving old stuff floating around: Leaving unused or outdated resources—such as Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, or PersistentVolumeClaims—running in the cluster. This often happens because Kubernetes does not automatically remove resources unless explicitly instructed, and there is no built-in mechanism to track ownership or expiration. Over time, these forgotten objects can accumulate, consuming cluster resources, increasing cloud costs, and creating operational confusion, especially when stale Services or LoadBalancers continue to route traffic. with a purpose or owner label. That way, you can easily query resources you no longer need. your cluster: run kubectl get all -n <namespace> to see what’s actually running, and confirm it’s all legit.Adopt Kubernetes’ Garbage Collection: K8s docs show how to remove dependent objects automatically.Leverage policy automation: Tools like Kyverno can automatically delete or block stale resources after a certain period, or enforce lifecycle policies so you don’t have to remember every single cleanup step.: After a hackathon, I forgot to tear down a “test-svc” pinned to an external load balancer. Three weeks later, I realized I’d been paying for that load balancer the entire time. Facepalm.6. Diving too deep into networking too soon: Introducing advanced networking solutions—such as service meshes, custom CNI plugins, or multi-cluster communication—before fully understanding Kubernetes' native networking primitives. This commonly occurs when teams implement features like traffic routing, observability, or mTLS using external tools without first mastering how core Kubernetes networking works: including Pod-to-Pod communication, ClusterIP Services, DNS resolution, and basic ingress traffic handling. As a result, network-related issues become harder to troubleshoot, especially when overlays introduce additional abstractions and failure points.Start small: a Deployment, a Service, and a basic ingress controller such as one based on NGINX (e.g., Ingress-NGINX).Make sure you understand how traffic flows within the cluster, how service discovery works, and how DNS is configured.Only move to a full-blown mesh or advanced CNI features when you actually need them, complex networking adds overhead.: I tried Istio on a small internal app once, then spent more time debugging Istio itself than the actual app. Eventually, I stepped back, removed Istio, and everything worked fine.7. Going too light on security and RBAC: Deploying workloads with insecure configurations, such as running containers as the root user, using the  image tag, disabling security contexts, or assigning overly broad RBAC roles like . These practices persist because Kubernetes does not enforce strict security defaults out of the box, and the platform is designed to be flexible rather than opinionated. Without explicit security policies in place, clusters can remain exposed to risks like container escape, unauthorized privilege escalation, or accidental production changes due to unpinned images.Use RBAC to define roles and permissions within Kubernetes. While RBAC is the default and most widely supported authorization mechanism, Kubernetes also allows the use of alternative authorizers. For more advanced or external policy needs, consider solutions like OPA Gatekeeper (based on Rego), Kyverno, or custom webhooks using policy languages such as CEL or Cedar.Pin images to specific versions (no more !). This helps you know what’s actually deployed.Look into Pod Security Admission (or other solutions like Kyverno) to enforce non-root containers, read-only filesystems, etc.: I never had a huge security breach, but I’ve heard plenty of cautionary tales. If you don’t tighten things up, it’s only a matter of time before something goes wrong.Kubernetes is amazing, but it’s not psychic, it won’t magically do the right thing if you don’t tell it what you need. By keeping these pitfalls in mind, you’ll avoid a lot of headaches and wasted time. Mistakes happen (trust me, I’ve made my share), but each one is a chance to learn more about how Kubernetes truly works under the hood.
If you’re curious to dive deeper, the official docs and the community Slack are excellent next steps. And of course, feel free to share your own horror stories or success tips, because at the end of the day, we’re all in this cloud native adventure together.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Louvre Heist: How Thieves Stole ‘Priceless’ Jewels in Broad Daylight | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SASDkIQjouI</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SASDkIQjouI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 20 Oct 2025 15:20:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thieves broke into France’s Louvre Museum in Paris, stealing crown jewels and prompting the world’s most visited museum to be evacuated.

DESCRIPTION
Principal Software Engineer Vanessa Formicola introduces the concept of "holistic engineering" – the practice of making technical decisions while factoring in non-technical forces that inevitably impact code and architecture. Through patterns like the "solo coding event", "everything but the kitchen sink" and "space abuse" she demonstrates how human behaviors, organizational dynamics, career frameworks, and company processes leave traces in codebases that no one intentionally designed.

Vanessa argues that technical leaders must look beyond pure technical excellence to understand the organic system they're working within, advocating for honest conversations about constraints and realistic architectural decisions that account for human factors.
The discussion extends to the emerging need for ethical engineering as our technical decisions increasingly impact society at unprecedented speed, with practical advice for teams to analyze their own systems through the lens of tech, people, and product dimensions.

"It is as true today as it was in 2011 that Javascript cryptography is Considered Harmful."



The main problem is code distribution. Consider an end-to-end-encrypted messaging web application. The application generates cryptographic keys in the client's browser that lets users view and send end-to-end encrypted messages to each other. If the application is compromised, what would stop the malicious actor from simply modifying their Javascript to exfiltrate messages? It is interesting to note that smartphone apps don't have this issue. This is because app stores do a lot of heavy lifting to provide security for the app ecosystem. Specifically, they provide integrity, ensuring that apps being delivered are not tampered with, consistency, ensuring all users get the same app, and transparency, ensuring that the record of versions of an app is truthful and publicly visible. 




It would be nice if we could get these properties for our end-to-end encrypted web application, and the web as a whole, without requiring a single central authority like an app store.
Further, such a system would benefit all in-browser uses of cryptography, not just end-to-end-encrypted apps. For example, many web-based confidential LLMs, cryptocurrency wallets, and voting systems use in-browser Javascript cryptography for the last step of their verification chains. In this post, we will provide an early look at such a system, called Web Application Integrity, Consistency, and Transparency (WAICT) that we have helped author. WAICT is a W3C-backed effort among browser vendors, cloud providers, and encrypted communication developers to bring stronger security guarantees to the entire web... We hope to build even wider consensus on the solution design in the near future.... 


We would like to have a way of enforcing integrity on an entire site, i.e., every asset under a domain. For this, WAICT defines an integrity manifest, a configuration file that websites can provide to clients. One important item in the manifest is the asset hashes dictionary, mapping a hash belonging to an asset that the browser might load from that domain, to the path of that asset. 


The blog post points out that the WEBCAT protocol (created by the Freedom of Press Foundation) "allows site owners to announce the identities of the developers that have signed the site's integrity manifest, i.e., have signed all the code and other assets that the site is serving to the user... We've made WAICT extensible enough to fit WEBCAT inside and benefit from the transparency components." The proposal also envisions a service storing metadata for transparency-enabled sites on the web (along with "witnesses" who verify the prefix tree holding the hashes for domain manifests). 


"We are still very early in the standardization process," with hopes to soon "begin standardizing the integrity manifest format. And then after that we can start standardizing all the other features. We intend to work on this specification hand-in-hand with browsers and the IETF, and we hope to have some exciting betas soon. In the meantime, you can follow along with our transparency specification draft,/A>, check out the open problems, and share your ideas."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Richard II vs Henry IV</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/richard-ii-vs-henry-iv</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68f25809888566c5b08a417e/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=ypU-Um462ZQju26_Rwd1_9bPfucDIXUCAMIszxGhIdQ" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Berlin, 1933: First-Hand Accounts Of Hitler&apos;s Rise To Power</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTXFA0eVbmQ</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/QTXFA0eVbmQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 21:00:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This documentary chronicles the pivotal first few months of 1933 in Germany, detailing Adolf Hitler's rapid consolidation of power.

That means climbing 3,000 meters in altitude, all while crossing rivers and a glacier. Called "transhumance,” the seasonal movement of livestock is now world cultural heritage.

Along with 1,400 sheep, shepherd Markus and his colleagues travel from South Tyrol to Austria every spring, journeying back again in the fall. Just like his ancestors, Markus looks after the animals on the mountain pastures throughout the summer. It’s an arduous task, but also a dream job.

Markus is also responsible for ensuring that the crossing of the Alps runs smoothly again this year. This is no easy feat, as the route over rockfall and ice is dangerous for animals and humans alike. Accidents happen again and again: "One slip and you're gone," he says. "But still, it's something very special. For me, it's an honor to be part of it."

Markus spends the summer alone on the mountain pasture, looking after healthy and sick sheep for months on end. A little further down, in the Schnalstal Valley, his brother Johann looks after the family farm and the animals that spend the summer there.

The two brothers are bucking a trend, as sheep farming is hardly financially viable anymore. There is little money to be made from the wool and meat of the animals. Shepherds and farmers increasingly need an additional source of income, or are changing their focus completely. 

Nonetheless, South Tyrolean sheep farmers are still hoping that this season will be better than the last, meaning one without injured sheep, and without accidents. It is important to them that the next generation will also have the opportunity to continue the tradition that has been going on for thousands of years.

It's been over a year since OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy exited the company. In the time since he's been gone, he coined and popularized the term "vibe coding" to describe the practice of farming out coding projects to AI tools. But earlier this week, when he released his own open source model called nanochat, he admitted that he wrote the whole thing by hand, vibes be damned. 
Nanochat, according to Karpathy, is a "minimal, from scratch, full-stack training/inference pipeline" that is designed to let anyone build a large language model with a ChatGPT-style chatbot interface in a matter of hours and for as little as $100. Karpathy said the project contains about 8,000 lines of "quite clean code," which he wrote by hand — not necessarily by choice, but because he found AI tools couldn't do what he needed. 
"It's basically entirely hand-written (with tab autocomplete)," he wrote. "I tried to use claude/codex agents a few times but they just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘No Kings’ Protesters Celebrate in San Francisco</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gTRYIT9ypbs</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gTRYIT9ypbs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 19 Oct 2025 00:35:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of chanting, drum-beating and sign-waving ‘No Kings’ protesters marched in San Francisco.

Or maybe they are liberators, depending on your point of view." Neowin reports:


Of all the projects trying to poach Windows users, Zorin Group might be the most aggressive, launching its biggest OS upgrade, Zorin OS 18, on the very day Windows 10 died.


In a recent post on X, Zorin Group celebrated the launch of version 18, claiming that it hit 100,000 downloads in "a little over 2 days". The company called it its "biggest launch ever" and claimed that over 72% of those downloads came from Windows... 

Zorin OS 18 now includes an updated version of WINE 10 for better support of Windows software. On top of that, there's also an expanded database that helps when it detects a Windows installer. The system checks the file and suggests the best way to run over 170 popular apps, whether that means installing a native Linux version, using the web-based alternative, or firing it up through WINE.

 


The article also notes LibreOffice's creators have been presenting Linux as a secure and cost-effective alternative since June, and "We have also seen initiatives like The "End of 10" Campaign by KDE, making the case for Linux and providing guides and info on how to switch."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Federal Troops &amp; Protestors face off in Portland</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eXuFCfviiCg</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eXuFCfviiCg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 18:31:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2396 - Andrew Schulz</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko5htRmVIrU</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ko5htRmVIrU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 18 Oct 2025 17:00:57 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Schulz is a stand-up comic, actor, and podcaster.

He wants to drive what he sees as a "demon” out of the Kremlin. But Russian authorities have fought back.

In March 2019, Alexander Gabyshev set out on an 8,000-kilometer walk from Siberia to Moscow. His destination: the Kremlin. He planned to use traditional shamanic rites to drive out the "demon”: Russian President Vladimir Putin. But Alexander Gabyshev’s protest march quickly attracted attention, and he became too much for the authorities. He continued to protest despite several arrests, until finally, in January 2021, authorities stormed his house and took him away to a psychiatric hospital. An expert has classified him as mentally ill, but Amnesty International calls him a political prisoner. Lawyers are fighting to secure his release - so far without success.

Private equity has long promised smooth returns, operational excellence, and sophisticated diversification. But behind the pitch decks and performance charts lies a growing crisis. In this video, we explore:
🔹 Why private equity firms are struggling to exit investments
🔹 The illusion of stability created by stale pricing
🔹 The role of leverage in driving returns — and fragility
🔹 The push into 401(k)s and what it means for retail investors
🔹 The rise of continuation funds, NAV loans, and other liquidity maneuvers
🔹 The social and regulatory backlash against PE roll-up strategies
🔹 What Bain, Buffett, and Cliff Asness really think about the model
From inflated IRRs to collapsing portfolio companies, the cracks are starting to show. Is private equity still a smart bet — or just a sophisticated shell game?

This article reflects its work, accomplishments, and insights into how a working group operates.)In the complex world of Kubernetes, policies play a crucial role in managing and securing clusters. But have you ever wondered how these policies are developed, implemented, and standardized across the Kubernetes ecosystem? To answer that, let's take a look back at the work of the Policy Working Group.The Policy Working Group was dedicated to a critical mission: providing an overall architecture that encompasses both current policy-related implementations and future policy proposals in Kubernetes. Their goal was both ambitious and essential: to develop a universal policy architecture that benefits developers and end-users alike.Through collaborative methods, this working group strove to bring clarity and consistency to the often complex world of Kubernetes policies. By focusing on both existing implementations and future proposals, they ensured that the policy landscape in Kubernetes remains coherent and accessible as the technology evolves.This blog post dives deeper into the work of the Policy Working Group, guided by insights from its former co-chairs:These co-chairs explained what the Policy Working Group was all about.Hello, thank you for the time! Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a bit about yourself, your role, and how you got involved in Kubernetes?: My name is Jim Bugwadia, and I am a co-founder and the CEO at Nirmata which provides solutions that automate security and compliance for cloud-native workloads. At Nirmata, we have been working with Kubernetes since it started in 2014. We initially built a Kubernetes policy engine in our commercial platform and later donated it to CNCF as the Kyverno project. I joined the CNCF Kubernetes Policy Working Group to help build and standardize various aspects of policy management for Kubernetes and later became a co-chair.: My name is Andy Suderman and I am the CTO of Fairwinds, a managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service provider. I began working with Kubernetes in 2016 building a web conferencing platform. I am an author and/or maintainer of several Kubernetes-related open-source projects such as Goldilocks, Pluto, and Polaris. Polaris is a JSON-schema-based policy engine, which started Fairwinds' journey into the policy space and my involvement in the Policy Working Group.: My name is Poonam Lamba, and I currently work as a Product Manager for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) at Google. My journey with Kubernetes began back in 2017 when I was building an SRE platform for a large enterprise, using a private cloud built on Kubernetes. Intrigued by its potential to revolutionize the way we deployed and managed applications at the time, I dove headfirst into learning everything I could about it. Since then, I've had the opportunity to build the policy and compliance products for GKE. I lead and contribute to GKE CIS benchmarks. I am involved with the Gatekeeper project as well as I have contributed to Policy-WG for over 2 years and served as a co-chair for the group.Responses to the following questions represent an amalgamation of insights from the former co-chairs.One thing even I am not aware of is the difference between a working group and a SIG. Can you help us understand what a working group is and how it is different from a SIG?Unlike SIGs, working groups are temporary and focused on tackling specific, cross-cutting issues or projects that may involve multiple SIGs. Their lifespan is defined, and they disband once they've achieved their objective. Generally, working groups don't own code or have long-term responsibility for managing a particular area of the Kubernetes project.You mentioned that Working Groups involve multiple SIGS. What SIGS was the Policy WG closely involved with, and how did you coordinate with them?The group collaborated closely with Kubernetes SIG Auth throughout our existence, and more recently, the group also worked with SIG Security since its formation. Our collaboration occurred in a few ways. We provided periodic updates during the SIG meetings to keep them informed of our progress and activities. Additionally, we utilize other community forums to maintain open lines of communication and ensured our work aligned with the broader Kubernetes ecosystem. This collaborative approach helped the group stay coordinated with related efforts across the Kubernetes community.Why was the Policy Working Group created?To enable a broad set of use cases, we recognize that Kubernetes is powered by a highly declarative, fine-grained, and extensible configuration management system. We've observed that a Kubernetes configuration manifest may have different portions that are important to various stakeholders. For example, some parts may be crucial for developers, while others might be of particular interest to security teams or address operational concerns. Given this complexity, we believe that policies governing the usage of these intricate configurations are essential for success with Kubernetes.Our Policy Working Group was created specifically to research the standardization of policy definitions and related artifacts. We saw a need to bring consistency and clarity to how policies are defined and implemented across the Kubernetes ecosystem, given the diverse requirements and stakeholders involved in Kubernetes deployments.Can you give me an idea of the work you did in the group?We worked on several Kubernetes policy-related projects. Our initiatives included:We worked on a Kubernetes Enhancement Proposal (KEP) for the Kubernetes Policy Reports API. This aims to standardize how policy reports are generated and consumed within the Kubernetes ecosystem.We conducted a CNCF survey to better understand policy usage in the Kubernetes space. This helped gauge the practices and needs across the community at the time.We wrote a paper that will guide users in achieving PCI-DSS compliance for containers. This is intended to help organizations meet important security standards in their Kubernetes environments.We also worked on a paper highlighting how shifting security down can benefit organizations. This focuses on the advantages of implementing security measures earlier in the development and deployment process.Can you tell us what were the main objectives of the Policy Working Group and some of your key accomplishments?The charter of the Policy WG was to help standardize policy management for Kubernetes and educate the community on best practices.To accomplish this we updated the Kubernetes documentation (Policies | Kubernetes), produced several whitepapers (Kubernetes Policy Management, Kubernetes GRC), and created the Policy Reports API (API reference) which standardizes reporting across various tools. Several popular tools such as Falco, Trivy, Kyverno, kube-bench, and others support the Policy Report API. A major milestone for the Policy WG was promoting the Policy Reports API to a SIG-level API or finding it a stable home.Beyond that, as ValidatingAdmissionPolicy and MutatingAdmissionPolicy approached GA in Kubernetes, a key goal of the WG was to guide and educate the community on the tradeoffs and appropriate usage patterns for these built-in API objects and other CNCF policy management solutions like OPA/Gatekeeper and Kyverno.What were some of the major challenges that the Policy Working Group worked on?During our work in the Policy Working Group, we encountered several challenges:One of the main issues we faced was finding time to consistently contribute. Given that many of us have other professional commitments, it can be difficult to dedicate regular time to the working group's initiatives.Another challenge we experienced was related to our consensus-driven model. While this approach ensures that all voices are heard, it can sometimes lead to slower decision-making processes. We valued thorough discussion and agreement, but this can occasionally delay progress on our projects.We've also encountered occasional differences of opinion among group members. These situations require careful navigation to ensure that we maintain a collaborative and productive environment while addressing diverse viewpoints.Lastly, we've noticed that newcomers to the group may find it difficult to contribute effectively without consistent attendance at our meetings. The complex nature of our work often requires ongoing context, which can be challenging for those who aren't able to participate regularly.Can you tell me more about those challenges? How did you discover each one? What has the impact been? What were some strategies you used to address them?There are no easy answers, but having more contributors and maintainers greatly helps! Overall the CNCF community is great to work with and is very welcoming to beginners. So, if folks out there are hesitating to get involved, I highly encourage them to attend a WG or SIG meeting and just listen in.It often takes a few meetings to fully understand the discussions, so don't feel discouraged if you don't grasp everything right away. We made a point to emphasize this and encouraged new members to review documentation as a starting point for getting involved.Additionally, differences of opinion were valued and encouraged within the Policy-WG. We adhered to the CNCF core values and resolve disagreements by maintaining respect for one another. We also strove to timebox our decisions and assign clear responsibilities to keep things moving forward.This is where our discussion about the Policy Working Group ends. The working group, and especially the people who took part in this article, hope this gave you some insights into the group's aims and workings.

The American Revolution | A Film by Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein and David Schmidt
Thirteen American colonies unite in rebellion, win an eight-year war to secure their independence, and establish a new form of government that would inspire democratic movements at home and around the globe. What begins as a political clash between colonists and the British government grows into a bloody struggle that will engage more than two dozen nations and forever change the world.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A Stone Age dating game... #human #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TgTHKFeA0gU</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/TgTHKFeA0gU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 16:00:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Find out where to watch Human in your region 👉 https://www.bbcearth.com/shows/human

This may seem unsurprising given that it's the latest game from developer Double Fine, which has for years carried itself with a distinct oddball identity, but Keeper is unusual even by the studio's standards. It doesn't fit cleanly into a traditional genre, and at some points feels more like a prestige art project. But this is also Double Fine at its most uncompromising, and the experience is better for it.The closest analog for Keeper is 2012's Journey--the two games share a wordless approach to narrative, an emphasis on movement that is at times slow and deliberate and at others joyfully fluid and fast, and even the seeming objective of making your way to a distant mountaintop. But that comparison feels reductive, because whereas Journey is a straightforward parable, Keeper keeps evolving, reinventing itself and its themes, and going to unexpected places. While you can quickly size up and understand the basic contours of Journey's world, the world of Keeper feels more alien, and the natural order of it isn't always clear.Let's back up. Keeper begins when a lighthouse shines its light to save a bird from an encroaching swarm of parasitic darkness. The lighthouse itself topples, snapping into pieces, but then reforms itself and grows a tripod of spindly, wobbly legs. You play through these awkward first steps, frequently face-planting--does a lighthouse have a face?--as you learn how to move around the world.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Comedy&apos;s Most Controversial Moments In History | Compilation</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMesy3PGWCw</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PMesy3PGWCw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 14:00:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Comedy has been around since the dawn of time - and in that time, the most famous comics in history have ALWAYS pushed boundaries, lived wild lives and have had crazy situations surrounding them.

I was too young (and timid!) to be sucking on necks, canoodling with the scantily-clad Jeanette, and traversing the Ocean House Hotel's utterly horrifying floorplan. And yet, I it. I loved knowing games could be... : dark, mature, and wicked.Alongside 2002's Neverwinter Nights, Bloodlines turned me into a die-hard fan of both TTRPGs and CRPGs in equal measure. So, needless to say, you can count me among the thousands of us who have been waiting--impatiently and a bit nervously--for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Infrastructure as Code • Kief Morris &amp; Abby Bangser</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7xSjv53xHE</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/n7xSjv53xHE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 17 Oct 2025 12:21:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for the GOTO Book Club.

DESCRIPTION
Abby Bangser (Principal Engineer at Syntasso) speaks with Kief Morris (Distinguished Engineer at Thoughtworks consultant and Author of "Infrastructure as Code") about the evolution of infrastructure as code over the past decade. They discuss how the field has grown from simple server configuration management to complex cloud architectures, the challenges of current tooling, and emerging solutions like System Initiative.

The conversation explores the importance of abstraction layers, the application of software development principles to infrastructure, and how AI might transform the field. They emphasize that infrastructure decisions must align with business needs rather than being treated as generic plumbing, highlighting the ongoing need for platform engineering and developer experience considerations.

More traditionally, these hosts are located in countries without treaties agreeing to enforce criminal laws from the US and other nations. These services often charge hefty sums and cater to criminals spreading malware or peddling child sexual abuse material and wares sold in crime-based flea markets.Next-gen, DIY hosting that can’t be tampered withSince February, Google researchers have observed two groups turning to a newer technique to infect targets with credential stealers and other forms of malware. The method, known as EtherHiding, embeds the malware in smart contracts, which are essentially apps that reside on blockchains for Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies. Two or more parties then enter into an agreement spelled out in the contract. When certain conditions are met, the apps enforce the contract terms in a way that, at least theoretically, is immutable and independent of any central authority.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ars Live recap: Is the AI bubble about to pop?

--

There are over 131 million pieces of debris currently whipping around the planet. They range in size from a grain of sand to the size of an entire bus. These orbital debris pose a serious threat to the thousands of satellites that underpin Earth’s vital technologies. So, how can we save our satellites and ourselves from all this trash? Jim Bentley and Imogen Ellen Napper investigate.

ABSTRACT
Building a global restaurant SaaS platform to support tens of thousands of stores is hard. Doing it while enabling rapid innovation for iconic brands like Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger is even harder. Each brand and market has unique operational and customer needs, which means pure architectures often give way to real-world constraints: speed, cost, and team composition.

This talk is a behind-the-scenes look at how we built the Byte by Yum! platform using a pragmatic mix of AWS services: containers where it makes sense, serverless where it shines, and managed open source where we need control. We’ll show how we created a core platform that supports menu management, ordering, kitchen operations, and AI workflows, using domain primitives that enable rapid iteration and reduced time to market.

We’ll also explore how we delivered new products quickly using AWS services like EventBridge schedules, DynamoDB streams, and Express Step Functions – while achieving high availability, extreme scale, and cost efficiency.

This is a no-nonsense look at what it takes to build and evolve a global platform: the tradeoffs, the building blocks, and why there’s never a silver bullet. [...]

The distributed nature of these systems makes it difficult for engineers to gain a clear view of how their systems behave, which can slow down troubleshooting and increase operational risk.groundcover is an observability platform that uses eBPF sensors to capture logs, metrics, and traces directly from the kernel. Critically, groundcover runs on a bring-your-own-cloud model so all data remains within the user’s own environment, which gives increased privacy, security, and cost efficiency.The company is also focused on adapting to how AI-generated code is changing observability. Code can now be produced at superhuman speed, which increases the challenges for reviewing code before it enters production. This means that observability is likely to play a growing role in code validation and providing guardrails.Yechezkel Rabinovich, or Chez, is the CTO and Co-founder of groundcover. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to discuss his journey from kernel engineering to building an eBPF-powered observability company. The conversation explores the power of eBPF, the realities of observability in modern systems, the impact of AI on software development and security, and where the future of root-cause analysis is headed.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by groundcover.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sunken Egyptian Temple Reveals Details About Cleopatra | Full Episode | Secrets of the Dead</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_DWgZEp-rs</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/R_DWgZEp-rs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 16 Oct 2025 01:30:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3mHxfbj | #SecretsDeadPBS
Just below the Mediterranean’s surface, in Alexandria’s harbor, lie the ruins of a mysterious ancient monument. For more than 20 years, French explorer Franck Goddio has been hoping to confirm these remains are a temple belonging to Cleopatra. If true, this discovery could reveal vital new information about Cleopatra’s reign and her connection with the goddess Isis.

With Pokemon Legends: Z-A, Game Freak sets its sights on rethinking the battle mechanics. For the first time, Pokemon battles are real-time, with attacks utilizing a cooldown system and positioning playing a key role. This fresh take on the battle system keeps Legends: Z-A engaging from start to finish, but a bland presentation leaves Legends: Z-A feeling like a relic of the past.Pokemon Legends: Z-A exclusively takes place in Lumiose City, the crown jewel of the Kalos region that is heavily inspired by Paris, France. A canal bisects the city, cafes can be found on nearly every block, and the Prism Tower--modeled after the Eiffel Tower--sits directly in the center. It's odd to play a Pokemon game set within the walls of a single town, but Lumiose City is probably one of the only places in the Pokemon universe that could support an entire game. That's not only due to its size, but also thanks to its rich history, which was established in 2013's Pokemon X and Y. Taking place only five years after the events of Pokemon X and Y means Legends: Z-A feels like a sequel rather than a spin-off.By day, you're tasked with uncovering the truth behind Rogue Mega Evolved Pokemon popping up all over the city, and by night, you're climbing the Z-A Royale tournament ladder. Before long, these two goals become intertwined and missions alternate between hunting down Mega Evolved Pokemon and raising your rank in the Z-A Royale. Each rank introduces you to a new opponent who represents a different faction in Lumiose City. Over the course of the tournament, you'll spend time with a martial arts club and a crime syndicate, as well as mingle in aristocratic society. As you're getting to know these characters and their backstories, Rogue Mega Evolved Pokemon will threaten the city and you'll need to defeat them before ranking up in the tournament. It's a predictable structure, but one that affords Game Freak the opportunity to delve into the different sides of Lumiose City and its eccentric denizens. Ivor is a hulking man with long blond hair who wants to tear down the Wild Zones so Pokemon and people can live together in harmony. Corbeau is a sharply dressed mob boss who's dedicated his life to making Lumiose City a safe place.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Thousands of customers imperiled after nation-state ransacks F5’s network</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/10/breach-of-f5-requires-emergency-action-from-big-ip-users-feds-warn/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1202018501-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 20:05:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Thousands of networks—many of them operated by the US government and Fortune 500 companies—face an “imminent threat” of being breached by a nation-state hacking group following the breach of a major maker of software, the federal government warned Wednesday.F5, a Seattle-based maker of networking software, disclosed the breach on Wednesday. F5 said a “sophisticated” threat group working for an undisclosed nation-state government had surreptitiously and persistently dwelled in its network over a “long-term.” Security researchers who have responded to similar intrusions in the past took the language to mean the hackers were inside the F5 network for years.During that time, F5 said, the hackers took control of the network segment the company uses to create and distribute updates for BIG IP, a line of server appliances that F5 says is used by 48 of the world’s top 50 corporations. Wednesday’s disclosure went on to say the threat group downloaded proprietary BIG-IP source code information about vulnerabilities that had been privately discovered but not yet patched. The hackers also obtained configuration settings that some customers used inside their networks.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anthropic’s Claude Haiku 4.5 matches May’s frontier model at fraction of cost</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/10/anthropics-claude-haiku-4-5-matches-mays-frontier-model-at-fraction-of-cost/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/haiku45_hero.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:53:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On Wednesday, Anthropic released Claude Haiku 4.5, a small AI language model that reportedly delivers performance similar to what its frontier model Claude Sonnet 4 achieved five months ago but at one-third the cost and more than twice the speed. The new model is available now to all Claude app, web, and API users.If the benchmarks for Haiku 4.5 reported by Anthropic hold up to independent testing, the fact that the company can match some capabilities of its cutting-edge coding model from only five months ago (and GPT-5 in coding) while providing a dramatic speed increase and cost cut is notable.As a recap, Anthropic ships the Claude family in three model sizes: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). The larger models are based on larger neural networks and typically include deeper contextual knowledge but are slower and more expensive to run. Due to a technique called distillation, companies like Anthropic have been able to craft smaller AI models that match the capability of larger, older models at functional tasks like coding, although it typically comes at the cost of omitting stored knowledge.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Battlefield 6 Review - Good Company</title><link>https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f</link><author>Richard Wakeling</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/43/434805/4581762-1515322092-battl.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:43:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.gamespot.com/feeds/reviews">GameSpot - Game Reviews</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At its best, Battlefield 6 is everything you could ask for from a Battlefield game. Intense, close-quarters firefights transition into long-range skirmishes as control points change hands and the action moves from the tight confines of half-destroyed buildings to open stretches of land. As fighter jets and helicopters swoop overhead, a medic pulls out a defibrillator and rushes into a hail of bullets to revive a squadmate who was just blown up trying to destroy a tank with a handful of C4.Elsewhere, a sniper taking residence in a high-rise building is snuffed out by a well-placed RPG, blowing a hole in their nest until the entire building eventually collapses in on itself, while just a few yards away, the burnt husk of a helicopter drops out of the sky as its previous occupants parachute to the ground amidst a salvo of gunfire. Battlefield 6 is a return to form for a multiplayer shooter that thrives on emergent chaos.For myriad reasons, Battlefield 2042 didn't evoke these moments often enough, leading Battlefield Studios--the collective name for developers DICE, Criterion, Motive, and Ripple Effect--to look to the past for the series' future. It's well-documented that Battlefield 3 and 4 were key inspirations in designing the series' latest iteration, and that's certainly reflected in how it plays. It's a safe approach, which isn't surprising given the negative reception to Battlefield 2042, especially when so many fans have been clamoring for a direct sequel to the series' fourth mainline entry. As a result, there's very little about Battlefield 6 that feels particularly fresh or new, but there's also no denying that it's quintessentially Battlefield. There's still nothing else quite like its multipronged chaos, so a return to form is more than enough to get pulses racing, even if it doesn't necessarily push the series forward.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Spec-driven development with Kiro (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/662</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/662/the-changelog-662.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re joined by Deepak Singh from the Kiro team.

The change represents a shift in how OpenAI approaches content restrictions, which the company had loosened in February but then dramatically tightened after an August lawsuit from parents of a teen who died by suicide after allegedly receiving encouragement from ChatGPT.“In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” Altman wrote in his post on X (formerly Twitter). The announcement follows OpenAI’s recent hint that it would allow developers to create “mature” ChatGPT applications once the company implements appropriate age verification and controls.Altman explained that OpenAI had made ChatGPT “pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues” but acknowledged this approach made the chatbot “less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems.” The CEO said the company now has new tools to better detect when users are experiencing mental distress, allowing OpenAI to relax restrictions in most cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>✨ The Subtle Genius of Kate Liu’s Chopin Grande Polonaise</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/gkDdREi5eDg</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gkDdREi5eDg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 14:36:21 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more: www.chopinpodcast.com/

https://a.co/d/906FTAZ

This book took 4 years to create. It was a labour of love, and I wanted it be reflective of my quality control on my channel, not a rush to make a quick buck. 

It grew out of Great Art Explained on YouTube, but it isn’t simply a transcript of the films. I look at other artists, and other artworks, as well as going deeper into artists I've covered on YouTube. 

The channel is fast, visual and conversational, designed for a world of scrolling and streaming, where attention moves quickly. A book moves differently. It gives the artworks space to breathe, lets you linger on details, and allows room for stories that don’t always fit within a fifteen-minute video.
On screen, the camera directs your gaze. On the page, you decide where to look and for how long. In print, reproductions are still and permanent; in video, they are moving and fleeting. Both approaches make art accessible, but they invite different kinds of engagement.

Think of this book not as a replacement for the channel but as its companion. The videos aim to make great art feel immediate. The book offers the chance to slow down, return, and reflect.

You will find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.I created the block diagrams using Eraser.Once upon at Meta, engineers wrote infrastructure code whenever they launched new services.And some services did a ton of concurrent processing during peak traffic. (Think of scheduling notifications or thumbnail creation.)Yet a pre-allocated infrastructure doesn’t scale dynamically.So they decided to set up a function as a service ().A FaaS is the serverless way to scale with increasing load. It lets engineers focus only on writing code and handles infrastructure deployment automatically. Thus improving the engineer’s productivity.Imagine FaaS as a job queue, but managed by someone else. is a framework for building real-time, multimodal AI that can see, hear, and respond in milliseconds.Built for developers who want to bring true intelligence to live video without being locked into a single model or transport provider.Open Source: Fork it, read it, improve it.Open Platform: Works with Stream Video or any WebRTC-based SDK.Flexible Providers: Plug in OpenAI Realtime, Gemini Live, or your favorite STT/TTS and vision models.Fully open, extensible, and ready for your next AI project.It’s possible to build a hyperscale FaaS by adding many servers and putting a load balancer in front.But this approach creates new problems.Restarting a server is better than keeping it idle for low costs.Yet a load balancer keeps servers running even if idle.Idle functions use up memory if kept warm.81% of functions get invoked at most once per minute.And most functions run for less than a minute on average.So this approach would cause high costs and waste computing resources. While an under-provisioned server would make a slow system.They run functions in separate Linux processes for data isolation within the worker. An idle Linux process doesn’t consume many resources.144 servers idle for 10 minutes → 1 server day WASTED.144 servers idle for 10 minutes → 1 extra machine → same THROUGHPUT.At Meta’s scale, they’d need 33,400 extra servers to achieve the same THROUGHPUT.So it’s necessary to reduce server idle time. Otherwise, they’d lose money on hardware costs.Servers crash. Also autoscaling adds new servers with varying traffic.The creation of a new virtual machine to handle a request is called a .Yet a cold start takes extra time before it can serve the first request because it’s necessary to:Start the virtual machine.Download the container image and function code.Initialize the container.Initialize the language runtime and function code.Do just-in-time () compilation.Also if the container gets shut down because a function isn’t used for a period, then it has a cold start problem again. Put simply, an early shutdown of the container causes latency because of re-initialization.And this could overload the services that the function is calling. (Thus affecting system availability.)Also there might be high variance in load. So it’s necessary to:Scale the serverless routing layer (discovery).Process the functions reliably without causing retry storms.Besides handling errors gracefully during function execution is important.Building a serverless platform with high CPU utilization and low latency is hard.So smart engineers at Meta used simple techniques to solve it.Here’s how they built a hyperscale distributed operating system (XFaaS):They run functions on a server called the .And categorizes those workers into namespaces based on programming language. This ensures that each worker gets only compatible code and executes faster.Also this technique gives extra security through physical isolation.While a worker within a namespace can run any function written in that language to reduce cold start. This is called the .Yet each server doesn’t run every function, but only a subset of them. This approach keeps the JIT-compiled code cache small and efficient.Also they form within a namespace by grouping workers that run the  functions often. This approach reduces memory usage and improves caching through better JIT code reuse.Repeated downloads increase latency and waste network bandwidth.So they  the function code and container images onto the server’s SSDs. This avoids repeated downloads and keeps an always-active runtime.Besides they do cooperative JIT compilation for faster execution of functions. It means only specific workers compile new function code. Then those workers send the compiled code to ALL workers. Thus preventing redundant compilation overhead.Ready for the next technique?2. Backend Service ProtectionThere’s a risk of overloading the backend services that the function is calling during a load spike.So they protect those services using -based throttling.They use a technique similar to TCP congestion control for throttling.Rate limiter throttles requests upon a backpressure signal from the backend service. For example, they track error, latency, and capacity.And then slowly increases the requests to those backend services.On congestion detection, it throttles requests again. Yet it throttles only the functions that call backend services for performance.Besides it’s necessary to control the number of concurrent functions calling a backend service to prevent overload.So they start with fewer concurrent function requests. This gives backend services enough time to warm up their cache and handle the load.It’s necessary to prevent a function from using up the resources during peak traffic.So they assign a limit to how many times a function can run or how many resources it can use. After a function reaches that limit, it’s throttled.Also they distribute function execution across data centers to distribute the load evenly. And delay the low-priority functions until low-traffic hours. Put simply, they run specific functions only when there’s enough free server capacity.Besides most services are stateless and replicated for scalability and fault tolerance. While stateful services are partitioned and replicated.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Secure Boot Bypass Risk Threatens Nearly 200,000 Linux Framework Laptops</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/10/14/2123205/secure-boot-bypass-risk-threatens-nearly-200000-linux-framework-laptops?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Roughly 200,000 Linux-based Framework laptops shipped with a signed UEFI shell command (mm) that can be abused to bypass Secure Boot protections -- allowing attackers to load persistent bootkits like BlackLotus or HybridPetya. Framework has begun patching affected models, though some fixes and DBX updates are still pending. BleepingComputer reports: According to firmware security company Eclypsium, the problem stems from including a 'memory modify' (mm) command in legitimately signed UEFI shells that Framework shipped with its systems. The command provides direct read/write access to system memory and is intended for low-level diagnostics and firmware debugging. However, it can also be leveraged to break the Secure Boot trust chain by targeting the gSecurity2 variable, a critical component in the process of verifying the signatures of UEFI modules.
 
The mm command can be abused to overwrite gSecurity2 with NULL, effectively disabling signature verification. "This command writes zeros to the memory location containing the security handler pointer, effectively disabling signature verification for all subsequent module loads." The researchers also note that the attack can be automated via startup scripts to persist across reboots.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Marlee Matlin: Not Alone Anymore | Full Documentary | American Masters | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaIbKprLfbw</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vaIbKprLfbw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 15 Oct 2025 01:01:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More from this series: https://to.pbs.org/42J0ocD | #AmericanMastersPBS

While its story and characters don't rise to the heights achieved in the best moments of the Digimon anime, Time Stranger is a consistently fun turn-based RPG with great voice acting and rewarding, strategic team-building.In Time Stranger, you play as an agent of a secret organization that works in the shadows of Tokyo to find, study, and confront urban legends, many of which turn out to be a strange lifeform the higher-ups have nicknamed Digimon. During your latest mission, you witness the emergence of a terrifying behemoth that destroys the city and begins spreading devastation across Japan.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to make vibe coding not suck…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLKrSVuT-Dg</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PLKrSVuT-Dg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 18:34:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Deploy your app the easy way with Sevalla and get $50 in free credits - https://sevalla.com/fireship

But in recent months, that's changed. With GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke leaving the company this August, and GitHub being folded more deeply into Microsoft's organizational structure, GitHub lost that independence. Now, according to internal GitHub documents The New Stack has seen, the next step of this deeper integration into the Microsoft structure is moving all of GitHub's infrastructure to Azure, even at the cost of delaying work on new features. 

[...] While GitHub had previously started work on migrating parts of its service to Azure, our understanding is that these migrations have been halting and sometimes failed. There are some projects, like its data residency initiative (internally referred to as Project Proxima) that will allow GitHub's enterprise users to store all of their code in Europe, that already solely use Azure's local cloud regions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are vampire bats dangerous? - Imran Razik</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5DhD5Nwl_0</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/H5DhD5Nwl_0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Follow the nighttime routine of a vampire bat as it hunts for prey, and find out how these unique creatures work together to survive.

--

Vampire bats are the only mammals to subsist on blood alone. Their ancient ancestors might have eaten parasites and insects off larger animals until vampire bats began feeding directly from those animals themselves. So, how do these nocturnal creatures find their sustenance? And what animals do they most commonly target? Imran Razik follows the nighttime routine of a vampire bat as she hunts.

Not used. Not allocated. Leaked. A basic calculator app is hemorrhaging more memory than most computers had a decade ago. Twenty years ago, this would have triggered emergency patches and post-mortems. Today, it's just another bug report in the queue. We've normalized software catastrophes to the point where a Calculator leaking 32GB of RAM barely makes the news. This isn't about AI. The quality crisis started years before ChatGPT existed. AI just weaponized existing incompetence. 

[...] Here's what engineering leaders don't want to acknowledge: software has physical constraints, and we're hitting all of them simultaneously. Modern software is built on towers of abstractions, each one making development "easier" while adding overhead: Today's real chain: React > Electron > Chromium > Docker > Kubernetes > VM > managed DB > API gateways. Each layer adds "only 20-30%." Compound a handful and you're at 2-6x overhead for the same behavior. That's how a Calculator ends up leaking 32GB. Not because someone wanted it to -- but because nobody noticed the cumulative cost until users started complaining. 

[...] We're living through the greatest software quality crisis in computing history. A Calculator leaks 32GB of RAM. AI assistants delete production databases. Companies spend $364 billion to avoid fixing fundamental problems. This isn't sustainable. Physics doesn't negotiate. Energy is finite. Hardware has limits. The companies that survive won't be those who can outspend the crisis. There'll be those who remember how to engineer.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>💥 Jury Chair Garrick Ohlsson: 3 WAYS to Start Chopin’s 2nd Sonata! 🎶</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/shorts/2KGQMMVzphI</link><author>Ben Laude</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/2KGQMMVzphI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 14:36:45 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnSFlVqRyNfIJDsmpkcY57w">Ben Laude</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Learn more: www.chopinpodcast.com/

The company says that “people use ChatGPT as a tool to learn and explore ideas” and argues “that only works if they trust ChatGPT to be objective.”But a closer reading of OpenAI’s paper reveals something different from what the company’s framing of objectivity suggests. The company never actually defines what it means by “bias.” And its evaluation axes show that it’s focused on stopping ChatGPT from several behaviors: acting like it has personal political opinions, amplifying users’ emotional political language, and providing one-sided coverage of contested topics.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Tech Leadership Challenges: Communication &amp; AI at Financial Times • Alice Bartlett &amp; Charles Humble</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyAcZ_iTwMg</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gyAcZ_iTwMg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 14 Oct 2025 12:27:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This interview was recorded for GOTO Unscripted.

The app, which requires no system permissions, can then effectively read data that any other installed app displays on the screen. Pixnapping has been demonstrated on Google Pixel phones and the Samsung Galaxy S25 phone and likely could be modified to work on other models with additional work. Google released mitigations last month, but the researchers said a modified version of the attack works even when the update is installed.Pixnapping attacks begin with the malicious app invoking Android programming interfaces that cause the authenticator or other targeted apps to send sensitive information to the device screen. The malicious app then runs graphical operations on individual pixels of interest to the attacker. Pixnapping then exploits a side channel that allows the malicious app to map the pixels at those coordinates to letters, numbers, or shapes.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The great software quality collapse (News)</title><link>https://changelog.com/news/165</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/news/165/changelog-news-165.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 13 Oct 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Denis Stetskov describes how we’ve “normalized catastrophe” in the software industry, Meta is officially handing React and React Native over to a foundation, The New Stack reports on GitHub’s Azure migration priority, Miguel Grinberg benchmarks Python 3.14, and The Oatmeal’s Matthew Inman published his take on AI art.Changelog++ members support our work, get closer to the metal, and make the ads disappear.

Sean Illing talks with Barbara Walter, one of the world’s leading experts on violent extremism and domestic terror. She’s the author of How Civil Wars Start, about how democracies unravel from within, and a professor at UC San Diego’s School of Global Policy and Strategy.

Walter talks to Sean about the warning signs she’s seeing in the US, why polarization and party identity become combustible, and what lessons we can draw from other countries. They also discuss what an American civil war might look like in the 21st century, the social and informational dynamics that accelerate breakdown, and whether America still has a path away from the brink.

ABSTRACT
In this talk I'll discuss my experiences building Kubernetes controllers using as a case study Contour, a new Kubernetes Ingress controller, that I've been working on since joining Heptio.

This presentation will cover:
• What an ingress controller is and what role it plays in a Kubernetes cluster.
• Why Heptio chose Lyft's Envoy proxy as the data plane for our ingress controller.
• How Contour works as a translator from Kubernetes to Envoy. The parts that were a good match, the parts that weren’t, and how we dealt with it.
• How to develop a component of an interactive system like Kubernetes while avoiding the dreaded compile/push/deploy time sink.

Over the past two years, the open source curl project has been flooded with bogus bug reports generated by AI models. The deluge prompted project maintainer Daniel Stenberg to publish several blog posts about the issue in an effort to convince bug bounty hunters to show some restraint and not waste contributors' time with invalid issues. Shoddy AI-generated bug reports have been a problem not just for curl, but also for the Python community, Open Collective, and the Mesa Project. 
It turns out the problem is people rather than technology. Last month, the curl project received dozens of potential issues from Joshua Rogers, a security researcher based in Poland. Rogers identified assorted bugs and vulnerabilities with the help of various AI scanning tools. And his reports were not only valid but appreciated. Stenberg in a Mastodon post last month remarked, "Actually truly awesome findings." In his mailing list update last week, Stenberg said, "most of them were tiny mistakes and nits in ordinary static code analyzer style, but they were still mistakes that we are better off having addressed. Several of the found issues were quite impressive findings...." 

Stenberg told The Register that about 50 bugfixes based on Rogers' reports have been merged. "In my view, this list of issues achieved with the help of AI tooling shows that AI can be used for good," he said in an email. "Powerful tools in the hand of a clever human is certainly a good combination. It always was...!" Rogers wrote up a summary of the AI vulnerability scanning tools he tested. He concluded that these tools — Almanax, Corgea, ZeroPath, Gecko, and Amplify — are capable of finding real vulnerabilities in complex code. 

The Register's conclusion? AI tools "when applied with human intelligence by someone with meaningful domain experience, can be quite helpful." 

jantangring (Slashdot reader #79,804) has published an article on Stenberg's new position, including recently published comments from Stenberg that "It really looks like these new tools are finding problems that none of the old, established tools detect."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Timeline Movies: 1985 - A Defining Year For Movies</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqVxk_6DU_k</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/PqVxk_6DU_k?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 14:00:41 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[1984 blessed movie goers with ‘Beverly Hills Cop’, ‘Ghostbusters’, ‘Gremlins’, ‘The Karate Kid’, ‘Romancing the Stone’, ‘The Terminator’, ‘Purple Rain’, and ‘Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom’.

Stakeholders consider the move a major success and milestone to digital sovereignty and saving costs. This move makes the state a pioneer in Germany. As a next major step Schleswig-Holstein plans to migrate their authorities and administrations desktop PCs to Linux. 

The state has achieved "digital sovereignty by ditching Microsoft for open source solutions," writes the site It's FOSS, adding that European nations "have generally been more progressive in adopting open source solutions for government operations."


The migration affected around 30,000 employees across various government departments. This includes the State Chancellery, ministries, judiciary, state police, and other state authorities. Over 40,000 mailboxes containing more than 100 million emails and calendar entries were moved to the new system. The state has adopted Open-Xchange as its email server solution and Thunderbird as the email client.... 

[Digitization Minister Dirk Schrödter] emphasized that "We are real pioneers. We can't fall back on the experience of others -, there is hardly a comparable project of this magnitude anywhere in the world."

Bluesky wound up geoblocking Mississippi. Over on a small forum I help run, we paid our lawyers to look into HB 1126, and the conclusion was that we were likely in the same boat. Collecting email addresses put us in scope of the bill, and it wasn’t clear whether the LLC would shield officers (hi) from personal liability.This blog has the same problem: people use email addresses to post and confirm their comments. I think my personal blog is probably at low risk, but a.) I’d like to draw attention to this legislation, and b.) my risk is elevated by being gay online, and having written and called a whole bunch of Mississippi legislators about HB 1126. Long story short, I’d like to block both a country  an individual state. Here’s how:First, set up geoipupdate as before. Then, in /etc/nginx/conf.d.geoblock.conf, pull in the country and city databases, and map the countries and states you’d like to block to short strings explaining the applicable law. This creates variables  and .Create an HTML page to show to geoblocked IPs. I’ve put mine in /var/www/custom_errors/451.html. The special comments here are Server-Side Include (SSI) directives; they’ll insert the contents of the  variable from nginx, which we’ll set shortly.Unavailable Due to
      Unavailable Due to
      Then, in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/whatever.conf, add an error page for status code 451 (unavailable for legal reasons). In the main  block, check the  and  variables, and use them to return status 451, and set the  variable for the SSI template:Test with , and reload with , as usual.Geoblocking is a bad experience in general. In Amsterdam and Frankfurt, I’ve seen my cell phone’s 5G connection and hotel WiFi improperly identified as being in the UK. I’m certain this is going to block people who aren’t in Mississippi. If you don’t want to live in this world either, start calling your representatives to demand better legislation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Chainsaw Stalls: Can Milei Cut Through Argentina’s Currency Collapse?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRUEqQmQoP0</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eRUEqQmQoP0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 11 Oct 2025 10:15:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to ➞ https://surfshark.com/boyle or use code BOYLE at checkout to get 4 extra months of Surfshark VPN!

Argentina’s economy is in crisis—again. President Javier Milei’s reforms slashed inflation and balanced the budget, but now the peso is under siege. In this video, we unpack the $20 billion U.S. bailout, the speculative pressure on Argentina’s currency, and the political risks ahead of the October 26 midterms.

We’ll look at:

Why the U.S. Treasury is buying pesos for the first time in decades
How Milei’s fixed-but-adjustable exchange rate is draining reserves
The geopolitical angle: China, soybeans, and Washington’s strategic bet
What history tells us about defending overvalued currencies
Whether Milei’s reform agenda can survive—or if the chainsaw has stalled

to give it a try.I’ve been using it for 3 months now and here are a few notes.why helix: language serversI think what motivated me to try Helix is that I’ve been trying to get a working
language server setup (so I can do things like “go to definition”) and getting
a setup that feels good in Vim or Neovim just felt like too much work.After using Vim/Neovim for 20 years, I’ve tried both “build my own custom
configuration from scratch” and “use someone else’s pre-buld configuration
system” and even though I love Vim I was excited about having things just work
without having to work on my configuration at all.Helix comes with built in language server support, and it feels nice
to be able to do things like “rename this symbol” in any language.One of my favourite things about Helix is the search! If I’m searching all the
files in my repository for a string, it lets me scroll through the potential
matching files and see the full context of the match, like this:For comparison, here’s what the vim ripgrep plugin I’ve been using looks like:There’s no context for what else is around that line.the quick reference is niceOne thing I like about Helix is that when I press , I get a little help popup
telling me places I can go. I really appreciate this because I don’t often use
the “go to definition” or “go to reference” feature and I often forget the
keyboard shortcut.some vim -> helix translationsHelix doesn’t have marks like , , instead I’ve been using  and
 to go back (or forward) to the last cursor locationI think Helix does have macros, but I’ve been using multiple cursors in every
case that I would have previously used a macro. I like multiple cursors a lot
more than writing macros all the time. If I want to batch change something in
the document, my workflow is to press  (to highlight everything), then 
to select (with a regex) the things I want to change, then I can just edit
all of them as needed.Helix doesn’t have neovim-style tabs, instead it has a nice buffer switcher ()
I can use to switch to the buffer I want. There’s a
pull request here to implement neovim-style tabs.
There’s also a setting  which can act a bit like tabs
with ,  for prev/next “tab” and  to close a “tab”.Here’s everything that’s annoyed me about Helix so far.I like the way Helix’s  works much less than how
vim reflows text with . It doesn’t work as well with lists. (github issue)If I’m making a Markdown list, pressing “enter” at the end of a list item
won’t continue the list. There’s a partial workaround
for bulleted lists but I don’t know one for numbered lists.No persistent undo yet: in vim I could use an
undofile so
that I could undo changes even after quitting. Helix doesn’t have that feature yet.
(github PR)Helix doesn’t autoreload files after they change on disk, I have to run
 () to manually reload them. Not a big deal.Sometimes it crashes, maybe every week or so. I think it might be
this issue.The “markdown list” and reflowing issues come up a lot for me because I spend
a lot of time editing Markdown lists, but I keep using Helix anyway so I guess
they can’t be making me that mad.switching was easier than I thoughtI was worried that relearning 20 years of Vim muscle memory would be really hard.It turned out to be easier than I expected, I started using Helix on a
vacation for a little low-stakes coding project I was doing on the side and
after a week or two it didn’t feel so disorienting anymore. I think it might be
hard to switch back and forth between Vim and Helix, but I haven’t needed to use
Vim recently so I don’t know if that’ll ever become an issue for me.The first time I tried Helix I tried to force it to use keybindings that were
more similar to Vim and that did not work for me. Just learning the “Helix way”
was a lot easier.There are still some things that throw me off: for example  in vim and  in
Helix don’t have the same idea of what a “word” is (the Helix one includes the
space after the word, the Vim one doesn’t).using a terminal-based text editorFor many years I’d mostly been using a GUI version of vim/neovim, so switching
to actually using an editor in the terminal was a bit of an adjustment.Every project gets its own terminal window, and all of the tabs in that
window (mostly) have the same working directoryI make my Helix tab the first tab in the terminal windowIt works pretty well, I might actually like it better than my previous workflow.I appreciate that my configuration is really simple, compared to my neovim
configuration which is hundreds of lines. It’s mostly just 4 keyboard
shortcuts.theme = "solarized_light"
[editor]
# Sync clipboard with system clipboard
default-yank-register = "+"

[keys.normal]
# I didn't like that Ctrl+C was the default "toggle comments" shortcut
"#" = "toggle_comments"

# I didn't feel like learning a different way
# to go to the beginning/end of a line so
# I remapped ^ and $
"^" = "goto_first_nonwhitespace"
"$" = "goto_line_end"

[keys.select]
"^" = "goto_first_nonwhitespace"
"$" = "goto_line_end"

[keys.normal.space]
# I write a lot of text so I need to constantly reflow,
# and missed vim's `gq` shortcut
l = ":reflow"
There’s a separate  configuration where I set some language
preferences, like turning off autoformatting.
For example, here’s my Python configuration:[[language]]
name = "python"
formatter = { command = "black", args = ["--stdin-filename", "%{buffer_name}", "-"] }
language-servers = ["pyright"]
auto-format = false
Three months is not that long, and it’s possible that I’ll decide to go back
to Vim at some point. For example, I wrote a post about switching to
nix a while back but
after maybe 8 months I switched back to Homebrew (though I’m still using NixOS
to manage one little server, and I’m still satisfied with that).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Medieval Sex</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/medieval-sex</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/68e68f9ff513ad2b811e9092/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=2NWFb2hKie65ANS5950IAw0loknN7CiELnTmvYXdChU" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 9 Oct 2025 23:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Warning: this episode contains explicit language.Medieval people weren’t prudish—far from it.

Balatro's gonzo approach to poker or Hades' riff on the isometric action game took the core of games that had been built from the start to accommodate repeated runs and then added the incentives of stacking, iterative power-ups and progression on top of them.Absolum is a game that is fundamentally built around the classic beat-'em-up. That genre is among the earliest, virtually a cave painting in video game history--the classic quarter-muncher. Beat-'em-ups were built for repeated fun because they needed to keep attracting you back to plunk in another coin, but they were also built to be remarkably hard. These qualities, which developers have sometimes struggled to modernize, make the roguelike element fit like a glove. As a result, Absolum is an absolute blast to play, over and over again.It shouldn't be surprising that Absolum hews so closely to its beat-'em-up roots. This is an original world from Guard Crush Games, the studio behind Streets of Rage 4. But rather than cleaning up the mean streets in a retro-modern setting, Absolum borrows liberally from swords-and-sorcery classics like Golden Axe. This is a fresh fantasy world in which a cataclysm resulted in the outlawing of all magic in the land of Talamh. A totalitarian ruler, the Sun King Azra, rules the land with an iron fist, and he hypocritically instrumentalizes magic to keep rogue wizards in check. As a small band of rebel wizards, you wage war on the Sun King, making your way to his imperial tower with the blessing of the Root Mother Uchawi, who revives you after each unsuccessful run.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An /intro to Python 3.14’s New Features</title><link>https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2025/10/09/an-intro-to-python-3-14s-new-features/</link><author>Mike</author><category>dev</category><category>python</category><pubDate>Thu, 9 Oct 2025 12:05:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/">Dev - Python Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Python 3.14 came out this week and has many new features and improvements. For the full details behind the release, the documentation is the best source. However, you will find a quick overview of the major changes here.As with most Python releases, backwards compatibility is rarely broken. However, there has been a push to clean up the standard library, so be sure to check out what was removed and what has been deprecated. In general, most of the items in these lists are things the majority of Python users do not use anyway.But enough with that. Let’s learn about the big changes!The biggest change to come to Python in a long time is the free-threaded build of Python. While free-threaded Python existed in 3.13, it was considered experimental at that time. Now in 3.14, free-threads are officially supported, but still optional.Free-threaded Python is a build option in Python. You can turn it on if you want to when you build Python. There is still debate about turning free-threading on by default, but that has not been decided at the time of writing of this article.Another new change in 3.14 is an experimental just-in-time (JIT) compiler for MacOS and Windows release binaries. Currently, the JIT compiler is NOT recommended in production. If you’d like you test it out, you can set   as an environmental variable. When running with JIT enabled, you may see Python perform 10% slower or up to 20% faster, depending on workload.Note that native debuggers and profilers (gdp and perf) are not able to unwind JIT frames, although Python’s own pdb and profile modules work fine with them. Free-threaded builds do not support the JIT compilter though.The last item of note is that GPG (Pretty Good Privacy) signatures are  not provided for Python 3.14 or newer versions. Instead, users must use  Sigstore verification materials. Releases have been signed using Sigstore since Python 3.11.Python Interpreter ImprovementsThere are a slew of new improvements to the Python interpreter in 3.14. Here is a quick listing along with links:Let’s talk about the top three a little. Deferred evaluation of annotations refers to type annotations. In the past, the type annotations that are added to functions, classes, and modules were evaluated eagarly. That is no longer the case. Instead, the annotations are stored  in special-purpose  and evaluated only when necessary with the exception of if  is used at the top of the module.the reason for this change it to improve performance and usability of type annotations in Python. You can use the new  module to inspect deferred annotations. Here is an example from the documentation:>>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format
>>> def func(arg: Undefined):
...    pass
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF)
{'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined', owner=<function func at 0x...>)}
>>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING)
{'arg': 'Undefined'}Another interesting change is the addition of multiple interpreters in the standard library. The complete formal definition of this new feature can be found in PEP 734. This feature has been available in Python for more than 20 years, but only throught the C-API. Starting in Python 3.14, you can now use the new  module.Why would you want to use multiple Python interpreters?They support a more human-friendly concurrency modelThey provide a true multi-core parallelismThese interpreters provide isolated “processes” that run in parallel with no sharing by default.Another feature to highlightare the template string literals (t-strings). Full details can be found in PEP 750. Brett Cannon, a core developer of the Python language, posted a good introductory article about these new t-strings on his blog. A template string or t-string is a new mechanism for custom string processing. However, unlike an f-string, a t-string will return an object that represents the static and the interpolated parts of the string.Here’s a quick example from the documentation:>>> variety = 'Stilton'
>>> template = t'Try some {variety} cheese!'
>>> type(template)
<class 'string.templatelib.Template'>

>>> list(template)
['Try some ', Interpolation('Stilton', 'variety', None, ''), ' cheese!']You can use t-strings to sanitize SQL, improve logging, implement custom, lightweight DSLs, and more!Standard Library ImprovementsPython’s standard library has several significant improvements. Here are the ones highlighted by the Python documentation:If you do much compression in Python, then you will be happy that Python has added Zstandard support in addition to the zip and tar archive support that has been there for many years.Compressing a string using Zstandard can be accomplished with only a few lines of code:from compression import zstd
import math

data = str(math.pi).encode() * 20
compressed = zstd.compress(data)
ratio = len(compressed) / len(data)
print(f"Achieved compression ratio of {ratio}")Another neat addition to the Python standard library is asyncio introspection via a new command-line interface. You can now use the following command to introspect:The  sub-command  will inspect the given process ID and siplay information about the current asyncio tasks. You will see a task table as output which contains a listing of all tasks, their names and coroutine stacks, and which tasks are awaiting them.The  sub-command will fetch the same information, but it will render them using a visual async call tree instead, which shows the coroutine relationships in a hierarcical format. Ths  command is especiialy useful for debugging stuck or long-running async programs.One other neat update to Python is that the default REPL shell now highlights Python syntax. You can change the color theme using an experimental API _colorize.set_theme() which can be called interactively or in the  script.

In this mode of software development, AI agents take a plain language prompt and generate entire applications, which dramatically lowers the barriers to entry and democratizes access to software creation.However, many enterprise environments have large, legacy codebases and these sprawling systems are complex, interdependent, and far less amenable to the greenfield style of vibe coding. Working effectively within them requires deep context awareness, something language models commonly struggle to maintain.Augment Code is an AI coding assistant that focuses on contextual understanding of large codebases in enterprise settings. It emphasizes tooling to manage large development surface areas while automating PRs and code review.Guy Gur-Ari is a Co-Founder at Augment. He has a PhD in physics and was previously a Research Scientist at Google where he worked on AI reasoning in math and science. Guy joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to talk about Augment Code, its focus on full context for large enterprise codebases, code review as the new bottleneck in AI-driven development, and much more.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Augment Code.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders.

The Janitor, with his sinisterly stretched arms that could seemingly reach the silent protagonist, Six, wherever she hid, was the stuff of children's night terrors. The chefs, with their unsettling fleshy masks, taunted me with the truth that was veiled behind them. It's a reveal the game never offers, leaving my imagination to run wild. The second game was still one I enjoyed very much, but it felt like Tarsier Studios had toned down some of the grotesque, haunting displays in the sequel. It failed to create memorable villains on par with the original. Little Nightmares 3 changes hands to the horror veterans at Supermassive Games, and though the addition of co-op is a great fit, it feels similarly sanitized and overly familiar at times. It's as though it looked to the sequel more than the original for the blueprint.Little Nightmares 3, like the previous games, is a cinematic horror-platformer, now newly built for two players--or one player and an AI companion. Without loading screens or virtually any prompts on the screen, it's extremely immersive, dropping you into a world that runs on nightmare fuel. Both this game's story and the broader universe are purposely vague, and this has always been the series' best attribute. Scurrying through dark apartments, rundown schools, foggy beaches, and haunted libraries nails the intent to present the world as an ever-present threat that is effective not just because it looks and sounds scary or because you'll reliably find yourself dashing away from monsters.Instead, the world itself is so hard to grasp, operating on dream logic, like someone has extracted the real memories of kids' nightmares and put them into a game. This means every creepy encounter with its monsters of different shapes and sizes always comes with bewilderment. What is this, and how do I evade it? The rules of the world are always changing, and with uncertainty comes fear.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Born Poor (full documentary) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WTbo4gb_c3o</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/WTbo4gb_c3o?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 8 Oct 2025 02:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Filmed across 14 years, this documentary follows three Americans as they grow from kids to teenagers to young adults, trying to pursue their dreams while dealing with an economy where they face more obstacles than opportunities. 

This journalism is made possible by viewers like you. Support your local PBS station here: https://www.pbs.org/donate

In the 2012 documentary “Poor Kids,” FRONTLINE explored poverty in America as it’s rarely seen: through the eyes of children. 

FRONTLINE’s new, 90-minute documentary “Born Poor” tells the stories of the now-grown children at the heart of “Poor Kids” — chronicling their lives from childhood to the present day, and offering a powerful, personal and longitudinal look at the realities of growing up in poverty in the U.S.

The documentary follows three kids from three families — Kaylie, Johnny and Brittany — across three chapters of their lives as they try to overcome poverty and pursue their dreams while dealing with an economy that presents more obstacles than opportunities.  

Despite difficulty, loss and setbacks, all three — now navigating parenthood themselves — refuse to give up on their pursuit of economic stability and an American dream that’s felt perpetually out of reach.

“Born Poor” is a FRONTLINE production with True Vision Productions. The director is Jezza Neumann. The producers are Jezza Neumann and Lauren Mucciolo. The senior producer is Frank Koughan. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

In this episode, Marco Palladino, CTO and co-founder of Kong Inc., explores what it means to build and scale AI responsibly when the rulebook is still being written. He explains that infrastructure should be the frontline defense for enforcing governance, security, and reliability in AI deployments. Marco shares how Kong’s technologies, including AI Gateway and AI Manager, help organizations rein in shadow AI, reduce LLM hallucinations, improve observability, and act as the foundation for agentic workflows.Marco Palladino is an inventor, software developer, and internet entrepreneur. As the CTO and co-founder of Kong, he is Kong’s co-author, responsible for the design and delivery of the company’s products, while also providing technical thought leadership around APIs and microservices within both Kong and the external software community.

--

Inhalers are mainly used to treat two conditions: asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. And there are two main types: preventative inhalers and rescue inhalers. Preventative inhalers can be used every day to control symptoms, while rescue inhalers are great in an emergency. So, how do they work? Anna Rothschild explains the science behind these simple yet powerful devices.

AI-generated content is flooding the internet, from videos and music to news and books. On top of that, generative AI is making false information look more convincing than ever. 
We're entering a new era of information overload, and figuring out what's real and what's not is becoming more and more of a challenge. While AI slop is slowly changing the internet as we know it, one thing is certain: kurzgesagt videos will always remain human-made.

The battle took place in 1403, when a rebellion broke out in England that would culminate in one of the bloodiest battles to ever take place on English soil. On 21st July 1403, King Henry IV with his son, the future Henry V, went head to head with a Northern traitor -  Henry Hotspur.  The Battle of Shrewsbury would pit rebel against royalist. Englishman against Englishman. At stake was the crown of England.

Meeting with experts, they will also learn about the power of the longbow - the English super weapon that would now be in the hands of both sides. And also get hands on with some medieval surgery techniques.

Find out how the Battle of Shrewsbury not only changed the history of England - but put the future Henry V on his own path towards destiny.

But that’s not really what it is. Memory doesn’t keep the past — it can also remake it. It stitches fragments into stories, and those stories — true or not — are what we end up calling our life, and sometimes, our collective history.

But Gartner analyst Philip Walsh said the research firm's position is that AI won't replace software engineers and will actually create a need for more.

"There's so much software that isn't created today because we can't prioritize it," Walsh said. "So it's going to drive demand for more software creation, and that's going to drive demand for highly skilled software engineers who can do it..." The idea that non-technical people in an organization can "vibe-code" business-ready software is a misunderstanding [Walsh said]... "That's simply not happening. The quality is not there. The robustness is not there. The scalability and security of the code is not there," Walsh said. "These tools reward highly skilled technical professionals who already know what 'good' looks like." 
"Economists, however, are also beginning to worry that AI is taking jobs that would otherwise have gone to young or entry-level workers," the article points out. "In a report last month, researchers at Stanford University found "substantial declines in employment for early-career workers'' — ages 22-25 — in fields most exposed to AI. Stanford researchers also found that AI tools by 2024 were able to solve nearly 72% of coding problems, up from just over 4% a year earlier." 

And yet Cat Wu, project manager of Anthropic's Claude Code, doesn't even use the term vibe coding. "We definitely want to make it very clear that the responsibility, at the end of the day, is in the hands of the engineers."
Wu said she's told her younger sister, who's still in college, that software engineering is still a great career and worth studying. "When I talk with her about this, I tell her AI will make you a lot faster, but it's still really important to understand the building blocks because the AI doesn't always make the right decisions," Wu said. "A lot of times the human intuition is really important."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>System Design Interview Question: Design Spotify</title><link>https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/p/spotify-system-design</link><author>Neo Kim</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ba330676-2588-4bb1-80bf-59b9b29480dd_1280x720.png" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 6 Oct 2025 10:02:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://newsletter.systemdesign.one/">Dev - System Design Newsletter</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get my system design playbook for FREE on newsletter signup:This post will help you prepare for the system design interview.Building a music streaming platform like Spotify is a classic system design problem.It includes audio delivery, metadata management, and everything in between.

The core requirements include:Artists can upload their songs.Users can search and play songs.Users can create and manage playlists.Users can maintain profiles.Basic monitoring and observability (health checks, error tracking, performance metrics).For audio formats, we use Ogg and AAC files with different bitrates for adaptive streaming. For example,64kbps for mobile data saving, 128kbps for standard quality,320kbps for premium users.On average, one song file at normal audio quality (standard bitrate) takes about 3MB of storage.While the main constraints are fast playback start times, minimal rebuffering, and straightforward operations. We handle rebuffering using adaptive quality switching.Let’s crunch some numbers to understand what we’re working with:3MB × 30M songs ≈ 90TB of raw audio data. This doesn’t include replicas across different regions. It also doesn’t include versioning overhead when artists re-upload songs.That’s why we’re looking at 2-3x this amount.Each song needs a title, artist references, duration, file URLs, and so on. At roughly 100 bytes per song × 30M songs ≈ 3GB. That’s not so much compared to the audio.User profiles, preferences, and playlist data are ~1KB × 500k users ≈ 0.5GB.The average listen time is 3.5 minutes at 128-160kbps; that’s roughly 3-4MB per stream.Let’s assume each user streams 10-15 songs daily.This leads to significant egress costs.The key insight is that audio dominates both storage costs and bandwidth. The metadata is just a small part in comparison.Spotify System Design: High Level ArchitectureThe architecture breaks down into these key components:The user-facing application handles UI, search, playback controls, and playlist management.It makes REST API calls to fetch metadata and manages local playback state.Client streams audio directly from blob storage or CDN using signed URLs.And cache recently played songs locally for faster playback on the same song replay.When things go wrong, it uses retry logic for API calls.The client handles network interruptions gracefully by pausing playback until connectivity returns.The load balancer spreads incoming requests across many API servers to prevent server overload.It could use round-robin or least-connections algorithms.Also it performs health checks every 30 seconds and removes unhealthy instances from rotation.This is essential for managing traffic spikes during album releases.Besides, it provides high availability against server failures and enables zero-downtime deployments.The application servers are stateless; they handle business logic, authentication, and data access.They validate JWT tokens and query the database for song metadata.They generate signed URLs for audio access and also save user actions for analytics.For reliability, they implement circuit breakers for database connections. Circuit breakers stop requests to failing services, preventing cascading failures.They use connection pooling to manage resources. This means reusing database connections instead of creating new ones for each request.They also provide fallback responses for non-critical features when dependencies are down.Object storage systems like AWS S3 could hold all the audio files. Files are organized in a hierarchical structure like /artist/album/song.oggThey’re accessed via signed URLs that expire after a few hours for security.Blob storage offers virtually unlimited scalability. It also comes with built-in durability and cost-effectiveness for large files. They replicate the storage across many regions for durability. However, it has higher latency than local storage and potentially higher egress costs. We could instead use a distributed file system like Hadoop Distributed File System (). But blob storage is more managed and reliable for most use cases.Now that we’ve covered the high-level architecture, let’s explore the request workflow:Here’s what happens when the user :User hits play → App sends a GET request API authentication → API server validates the JWT token.Metadata lookup → API server queries SQL database for song details (metadata).URL generation → API server creates a signed URL for blob storage access.Audio streaming → App fetches chunks of audio (range requests) directly from blob storage using HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HLS or DASH), which allows smooth playback, automatic bitrate switching, and broad device compatibility.Analytics → App periodically calls  to track plays and listening time.Here’s what happens when the :Artist uploads a song → The app sends it to the server using POST request with multipart form data.File validation → API server checks its format, duration, and file size limits.Blob storage → API server uploads file to /pending/{upload_id}/song.oggMetadata processing → API server triggers a separate background service to read the uploaded file and extract details like duration, bitrate, and also generate preview images.Database insert → API server then creates entries in these tables:: adds the new song record.: adds the artist details if not already there.: links the artist to the song.File promotion → The system moves the song from pending to its final, organized location /artist/{id}/album/{id}/song.oggCDN invalidation → CDN stores cached copies of content (like artist pages, album metadata, song details) closer to users for fast delivery. It clears old cached data so users see the latest songs and artist updates right away.Our core endpoints would look something like:Search different content types with paginationGET /search?q={query}&type=song,artist&limit=20&offset=0Get trending songs, optionally filtered by genreGET /songs/trending?genre={genre}&limit=50Get all songs by a specific artistGET /artists/{id}/songs?limit=50Get song metadata and streaming URLDirect streaming endpoint (alternative to signed URLs)Get playlist details with an optional song listGET /playlists/{id}?include_songs=true{
  “name”: “My Favorites”,
  “is_public”: false
}Add songs to the playlistPUT /playlists/{id}/songs{
  “song_ids”: [123, 456, 789],
  “position”: 5
}Remove a song from the playlistDELETE /playlists/{id}/songs/{song_id}Get the current user’s playlistsGet songs liked by the userGET /users/me/liked-songs?limit=50&offset=0POST /users/me/follow/{artist_id}Most endpoints return JSON with a consistent structure. The JSON includes metadata such as total_count, limit, offset for pagination, and proper HTTP status codes.And the app sends the JWT token in the  header for authentication.This is where we split responsibilities between two storage types:The system uses blob storage to .The audio files are immutable; they rarely change once uploaded.We’d organize them with a sensible folder structure/artist/{artistId}/album/{albumId}/{songId}.oggThis makes it easy to manage uploads and serves as your source of truth for audio content.The system uses an SQL database, such as PostgreSQL, to  with strong consistency. Users: stores information about each user.Artists: stores information about each artist.Songs: stores information about each song.Playlists: stores information about playlists created by users.PlaylistItems: stores the songs inside a playlist.ArtistSongs: a junction table that stores relationships between songs and artists. For example, there could be many-to-many relationships with a song by many artists or many songs by a single artist.We chose SQL because we need JOINs for complex queries.For example, to find all songs by artists that a user follows.Also, you want referential integrity to prevent orphaned records. It means ensuring every record in one table points to a valid record in another table, so there are no orphan entries with missing links.We can optimize common queries by adding database indexes on frequently accessed columns.The trigram indexes on song titles and artist names enable fast search capabilities, handling typos and partial matches that users expect.And the playlist items index speeds up queries when fetching songs for a specific playlist or finding which playlists contain a specific song.Here’s the full user journey when they :App sends a  request to the API.API queries the SQL database for song metadata.The API returns metadata along with a signed URL pointing directly to blob storage or proxies the audio stream itself.The client makes range requests to stream the audio in chunks.App periodically sends progress information to the API for analytics.The signed URL approach is better because it takes the load off the API servers. But the proxy approach gives us more control over access patterns.When we hit real scale, the numbers get much bigger than in the initial phase:We have 200 million songs and 50 million usersSong metadata: 100 bytes × 200M songs ≈ 20 GBUser metadata: 1KB × 50M users ≈ 50 GBAudio storage: 3MB × 200M songs ≈ 600 TB (before replicas and regional copies)Now, we need to make some major architectural changes:Popular songs get cached at edge locations worldwide to reduce latency for users. For example, a song cached in Germany serves much faster to European users than fetching it from the origin storage in the United States.We could implement least recently used () eviction for cache management. LRU automatically removes the least accessed content when storage fills up. And the cache would fetch from the origin storage on a cache miss.The CDN fetches content from blob storage using signed URLs, which allows it to serve the content securely.The major advantage is a better user experience with fast load times and reduced capacity costs. You’re not serving every stream from your origin servers.We need to introduce leader-follower replication to scale the database. Followers handle read traffic like searches and metadata lookups. While the leader handles writes like new uploads and playlist changes.This approach works well because music streaming is heavily read-biased. Users search and browse far more than they upload or change playlists.The major advantage is that you can scale read capacity by adding more followers. It also provides automatic failover if the leader goes down.However, we might deal with replication lag. Followers could be slightly behind the leader. Also, there’s increased complexity from managing many database instances. We also face potential consistency issues where a user might not immediately see their own writes if routed to a follower.When catalog growth or hot partitions become an issue, we’ll need to consider sharding strategies.  splits data across many database instances. For example, we could shard users by geography. US users go on one shard, EU users on another. Or we partition songs by artist ID ranges.This gives us horizontal scalability and improves performance by keeping related data together. But the downside is that cross-shard queries become expensive or impossible. We lose some SQL features like foreign keys across shards. Besides, rebalancing data on growth becomes a complex operational challenge.For a music platform, we’d start with geographic sharding. Most users primarily listen to artists from their region. However, you’d need a strategy for global artists whose songs are popular everywhere.API Layer Horizontal ScalingMorning commutes and evening listening sessions create predictable traffic spikes. So it’s necessary to set up many stateless API servers behind the load balancer to handle varying loads throughout the day.These servers don’t maintain any user session state and use JWT tokens.Adding capacity is straightforward.We just spin up more instances, and the load balancer automatically includes them. This approach is cost-effective. Scale up during peak hours, then scale down overnight. It provides fault tolerance. If one server crashes, the others continue serving. It also enables rolling deployments without downtime.The main tradeoff is that keeping servers truly stateless requires careful design. You can’t store anything locally between requests. This means more database calls and potential performance issues.Let’s also introduce monitoring to track system health and find performance issues.Health checks across all services with automatic traffic routing away from unhealthy instances.Retries with exponential backoff for transient failures, especially for audio streaming, where network hiccups are common.Here are some key metrics to watch:Time to first byte for audio streamsError rates across all endpointsCDN cache hit ratios (should be 85% + for popular content)Besides, implement a simple fallback strategy:If the CDN misses, then fetch from origin storage and populate the cache for next time.If database replicas are down, fall back to the leader with circuit breaker protection.Start with a simple design and scale incrementally. We don’t over-engineer for problems we don’t have yet, but the architecture naturally accommodates growth when it’s needed.👋 I’d like to thank Hayk for writing this newsletter!It’ll help you master the essential system design skills, not just in theory but in practice, and land senior developer roles.Subscribe to get simplified case studies delivered straight to your inbox:Want to advertise in this newsletter? 📰Thank you for supporting this newsletter.You are now 175,001+ readers strong, very close to 176k.

After all, npm wasn't the only software library hit by a supply chain attack, argues the Linux Security blog. "PyPI and Docker Hub both faced their own compromises in 2025, and the overlaps are impossible to ignore."
 Phishing has always been the low-hanging fruit. In 2025, it wasn't just effective once — it was the entry point for multiple registry breaches, all occurring close together in different ecosystems... The real problem isn't that phishing happened. It's that there weren't enough safeguards to blunt the impact. One stolen password shouldn't be all it takes to poison an entire ecosystem. Yet in 2025, that's exactly how it played out... 

Even if every maintainer spotted every lure, registries left gaps that attackers could walk through without much effort. The problem wasn't social engineering this time. It was how little verification stood between an attacker and the "publish" button. Weak authentication and missing provenance were the quiet enablers in 2025... Sometimes the registry itself offers the path in. When the failure is at the registry level, admins don't get an alert, a log entry, or any hint that something went wrong. That's what makes it so dangerous. The compromise appears to be a normal update until it reaches the downstream system... It shifts the risk from human error to systemic design. 

And once that weakly authenticated code gets in, it doesn't always go away quickly, which leads straight into the persistence problem... Once an artifact is published, it spreads into mirrors, caches, and derivative builds. Removing the original upload doesn't erase all the copies... From our perspective at LinuxSecurity, this isn't about slow cleanup; it's about architecture. Registries have no universally reliable kill switch once trust is broken. Even after removal, poisoned base images replicate across mirrors, caches, and derivative builds, meaning developers may keep pulling them in long after the registry itself is "clean." 

The article condlues that "To us at LinuxSecurity, the real vulnerability isn't phishing emails or stolen tokens — it's the way registries are built. They distribute code without embedding security guarantees. That design ensures supply chain attacks won't be rare anomalies, but recurring events."BR> 

So in a world where "the only safe assumption is that the code you consume may already be compromised," they argue, developers should look to controls they can enforce themselves:

 Verify artifacts with signatures or provenance tools. Pin dependencies to specific, trusted versions. Generate and track SBOMs so you know exactly what's in your stack. Scan continuously, not just at the point of install.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Introducing Headlamp Plugin for Karpenter - Scaling and Visibility</title><link>https://kubernetes.io/blog/2025/10/06/introducing-headlamp-plugin-for-karpenter/</link><author></author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><pubDate>Mon, 6 Oct 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://kubernetes.io/">Dev - Kubernetes Blog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Headlamp is an open‑source, extensible Kubernetes SIG UI project designed to let you explore, manage, and debug cluster resources.Karpenter is a Kubernetes Autoscaling SIG node provisioning project that helps clusters scale quickly and efficiently.

Today, we delve into the grinding class conflicts and ferocious political divisions that split Spain in two, from the dictatorship of the 1920s to the ambitious and divisive government of the early 1930s. We explore why democracy unravelled in Spain, and how foreign intervention - or lack of it - turned a bungled coup into a full-blown conflict that killed half a million people, and gave rise to the regime of Francisco Franco.We're joined by Helen Graham, Professor of Modern European History at Royal Holloway and author of 'In the Shadow of Defeat: Radical Lives After the Spanish Civil War'.

Two companies collapsed last month. One sold used cars, the other distributed brake pads and spark plugs. Both issued debt rated AAA. Now their bonds are trading at cents on the dollar—and Wall Street is pretending not to notice.
In this video, we dig into down the bankruptcies of Tricolor Holdings and First Brands Group to understand what they reveal about private credit, and why supposedly safe securities are starting to look a lot less safe. We’ll look at hidden leverage, double-pledged collateral, shadow banking, and the growing disconnect between risk and reward in today’s credit markets.

Until now, Jules -- Google's asynchronous coding agent -- was only accessible via its website and GitHub. On Thursday, the company introduced Jules Tools, a command-line interface that brings Jules directly into the developer's terminal. The CLI lets developers interact with the agent using commands, streamlining workflows by eliminating the need to switch between the web interface and GitHub. It allows them to stay within their environment while delegating coding tasks and validating results. "We want to reduce context switching for developers as much as possible," Kathy Korevec, director of product at Google Labs, told TechCrunch.
 
Jules differs from Gemini CLI in that it focuses on "scoped," independent tasks rather than requiring iterative collaboration. Once a user approves a plan, Jules executes it autonomously, while the CLI needs more step-by-step guidance.
