CNBC: Attorneys for the FTC made the request during a status hearing on Wednesday before Judge John Chun in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington. Chun had set a Sept. 22 start date for the trial. Jonathan Cohen, an attorney for the FTC, asked Chun for a two-month continuance on the case due to staffing and budgetary shortfalls. 

The FTC's request to delay due to staffing constraints comes amid a push by the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency to reduce spending. DOGE, which is led by tech baron Elon Musk, has slashed the federal government's workforce by more than 62,000 workers in February alone.

Anyone who makes it to one of its 84 institutes belongs to the elite: an organization that counts 31 Nobel Prize laureates among its ranks. But there is a dark side to its facade.
 
For months, DW's investigative unit, along with German news magazine Der Spiegel, has investigated allegations of misconduct perpetrated by senior scientific staff at Max Planck institutes. We spoke to more than 30 young scientists, many who described abusive behavior and toxic environments. They were afraid to report the abuse, fearing the consequences, and the few who did report say they were discouraged from doing so.
 
DW goes behind the scenes of Germany's elite research institutes to find out why abusive behavior and toxic work environments remain resilient in the face of opposition.

This is astonishing progress.At the same time, neither QUIC nor HTTP/3 are included in the standard libraries of any major languages including Node.js, Go, Rust, Python or Ruby. Curl recently gained support but it's experimental and disabled in most distributions. There are a rare few external libraries for some languages, but all are experimental and/or independent of other core networking APIs. Despite mobile networking being a key use case for HTTP/3, Android's most popular HTTP library has no support. Popular servers like Nginx have only experimental support, disabled by default, Apache has no support or published plan for support, and Ingress-Nginx (arguably the most popular Kubernetes reverse proxy) has dropped all plans for HTTP/3 support punting everything to a totally new (as yet unreleased) successor project instead.Really it's hard to point to any popular open-source tools that fully support HTTP/3: rollout has barely even started.This seems contradictory. What's going on?Why do we need more than HTTP/1.1?Let's step back briefly. Why does this matter? Who cares about whether HTTP/3 is being rolled out successfully or not? If browser traffic and the big CDNs support HTTP/3, do we even need it in other client or server implementations?You could make much the same argument for HTTP/3: this is useful for the high-latency many-requests traffic of web browsers & CDNs, but irrelevant elsewhere.Even just considering HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2 though, the reality of multiplexing benefits is more complicated:Latency of responses isn't just network RTT: a slow server response because of server processing will block your TCP connection just as hard as network latency.Your load balancer is often  co-located with your backend, e.g. if you serve everything through a geographically distributed CDN, which serves most content from its cache, but falls back to a separate application server backend for dynamic content & cache misses.Long-lived TCP connections die. Networking can fail in a million ways, even within data centers, and 'keep-alive' is a desperate plea at best. Even HTTP itself will force this: there's cases like a response body failing half-way through that are unrecoverable in HTTP/1.1 without killing the connection entirely.Any spikes in traffic mean you'll end up with the wrong number of TCP connections one way or the other: either you need an enormous unused pool available at all times, or you'll need to open a flood of new connections as traffic spikes come in, and so deal with TCP slow start, RTT & extra TLS handshakes as you do so.There's a lot of traffic that's not websites  not just within in datacenters. Mobile apps definitely do have network latency issues, API servers absolutely do have slow endpoints that can block up open connections, and IoT is a world built almost exclusively of unreliable networks and performance challenges. All of these cases get value from HTTP/2 & HTTP/3.Moving beyond multiplexing, there's plenty of other HTTP/2 benefits that apply beyond just load balancers & browsers:HTTP header compression (HPACK and QPACK in HTTP/2 & HTTP/3 respectively) makes for a significant reduction in traffic in many cases,  on long-lived connections such as within internal infrastructure. This is useful on the web, but can be an even bigger boost on mobile & IoT scenarios where networks are limited and unrealiable.Bidirectional HTTP request & response streaming (only possible in HTTP/2 & HTTP/3) enables entirely different communication patterns. Most notably used in gRPC (which  HTTP/2 for most usage) this means the client and server can exchange continuous data within the same 'request' at the same time, acting similarly to a websocket but within existing HTTP semantics.Both protocols support advanced prioritization support, allowing clients to indicate priority of requests to servers, to more efficiently allocate processing & receive the data they need most urgently. This is valuable for clients, but also between the load balancer and server: a cache miss for a waiting client has a very different priority to an optional background cache revalidation.All that is just for HTTP/2. HTTP/3 improves on this yet further, with:Significantly increased resilience to unreliable networks. By moving away from TCP's strict packet ordering, HTTP/3 makes each stream within the connection fully independent, so a missed packet on one stream doesn't slow down another stream.Zero round-trip connection initialization. TLS1.3 allows zero round-trip connection setup when resuming a connection to a known server, so you don't need to wait for the TLS handshake before sending application data. For HTTP/1 & HTTP/2 though, you still need a TCP handshake first. With QUIC, you can do 0RTT TLS handshakes, meaning you can connect to a server and send an HTTP request immediately, without waiting for a single packet in response, so there's no unnecessary RTT delay whatsoever.Reductions in traffic size, connection count, and network round trips that can result in reduced battery use for clients and reduced processing, latency & bandwidth for servers.Support for connection migration allowing a client to continue the same connection even as its IP address changes, and in theory even supporting multi-path connections using multiple addresses (e.g. a single connection to a server using both WiFi & cellular at the same time for extra bandwidth/reliability) in future.Improved network congestion handling by moving away from TCP: QUIC can use Bottleneck Bandwidth and RTT (BBR) for improved congestion control via active detection of network conditions, includes timestamps in each packet to help measure RTT, has improved detection of and recovery from packet loss, has better support for explicit congestion notifications (ECN) to actively manage congestion before packet loss, and may gain forward-error correction (FEC) support in future too.Support for WebTransport, a new protocol providing bidirectional full-duplex connections (similar to WebSockets) but supporting multiplexed streams to avoid head-of-line blocking, fixing various legacy WebSocket limitations (like incompatibility with CORS), and allowing streams to be unreliable and unordered - effectively providing UDP-style guarantees and lower-latency within web-compatible stream connections.In addition to the theory, there's some concrete measureable benefits being reported already. RequestMetric ran some detailed benchmarks showing some astonishing performance improvements for example:And Fastly shared the major improvements in time-to-first-byte they're seeing in the real world:This all very clearly Good Stuff.Now that the technology is standardized, widely supported in browsers & CDNs and thoroughly battle-tested, I think it's clear that  developers should be able to get these benefits built into their languages, servers & frameworks.That's not what's happened though: despite its benefits and frequent use in network traffic, most developers can't easily start using HTTP/3 end-to-end today. In this, HTTP/3 has thrown a long-growing divide on the internet into sharp relief. Nowadays, there's two very different kinds of web traffic:Major browsers plus some very-specific mobile app traffic, where a small set of finely tuned & automatic-updating clients talk to a small set of very big servers, with as much traffic as possible handled by either an enormous CDN (Cloudflare, Akamai, Fastly, CloudFront) and/or significant in-house infra (Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft).Everybody else: backend API clients & servers, every other mobile app, every smaller CDN, websites without a CDN, desktop apps, IoT, bots & indexers & scrapers, niche web browsers, self-hosted homelabs, CLI tools & scripts, students learning about network protocols, you name it.Let's simplify a bit, and describe these two cases as 'hyperscale web' and 'long-tail web'. Both groups are building on the same basic standards, but they have very different focuses and needs, and increasingly different tools & platforms. This has been true for quite a while, but the reality of HTTP/3 makes it painfully clear.There's a few notable differences in these groups:The long-tail world is fragmented into different implementations, almost by definition. Most of the biggest implementations are open-source organizations with relatively little direct funding or full-time engineering power available, and much work is done by volunteers with no mandated central direction or clear focus.The hyperscale world is controlled by a relatively small number of key stakeholders on both client & server side (you can count the relevant companies without taking your socks off). This lets them agree standards to fit their needs quickly & effectively - literally putting a representative of every implementation in the same room.The hyperscale ecosystem has far more concentrated cash & motivations. It's a small number of players comprising some of the most valuable companies in the world, with business models that tie milliseconds of web performance directly to their bottom line.The long-tail is completely dependent on open-source implementations and shared code. If you want to build a new mobile app tomorrow, you obviously should not start by building an HTTP parser.The hyperscale ecosystem isn't worried about access to open-source implementations at all. They have sufficient engineering resources and complicated use cases that building their own custom implementation of a protocol from scratch can make perfect sense. Google.com is not going to be served by an Apache module with default settings, and Instagram is not sending requests with the same HTTP library as a Hello-World app.The combination of hyperscale's evergreen clients plus money & motivation plus tight links between implementers and the business using the tools, means they can move fast to quickly build, ship & iterate new approaches.Long-tail implementations are only updated relatively rarely (how many outdated Apache servers are there on the web?) and the maintainers are a tiny subset of the users, who care significantly about stability and avoiding breaking changes. Long-tail tool maintainers  just move fast and break things.You can see the picture I'm painting. These two groups exist on the same web, but in very different ways.Some of this might sound like the hyperscale gang are the nefarious baddies. That is not what I mean (fine, yes, there's an interesting conversation there more broadly, but talking strictly about network protocols here). Regarding HTTP/3 specifically, this is some  engineering work that is solving real problems on the web, through some astonishingly tidy cooperation on open standards across different massive organizations. That's great!There are many  people using services built by these companies, and their obsession with web performance is improving the quality of those services for large numbers of real people every day. This is very cool.However, this would be much cooler if it was accessible to every other server, client & developer too. Most notably, this means the next generation of web technology is being defined & built by one minority group, and the larger majority have effectively no way to access this technology right now (despite years of standardization and development) other than paying money to the CDNs of that first minority group to help. Not cool.I think the hyperscaler/long-tail divide is the fundamental cause here, but that's created quite a few more concrete issues downstream, the most notable of which is OpenSSL's approach to QUIC.BoringSSL shipped a usable API for QUIC implementations back in 2018.OpenSSL did not, so various forks like QuicTLS appeared, providing OpenSSL plus BoringSSL's QUIC API.An ecosystem of QUIC & HTTP/3 implementations (most notably Quiche, msh3/msquic, and nghttp3/ngtcp2) were built on top of BoringSSL and these forks over the many subsequent years.OpenSSL has since slowly implemented an incompatible approach that this ecosystem can't directly use, with client support released in OpenSSL 3.2 (2023), and server support landing imminently in OpenSSL 3.5 (2025).Some would argue this is a major mistake by OpenSSL, while I think OpenSSL would argue that BoringSSL's design is flawed and/or unsuitable for OpenSSL, and it was worth taking the time to do it right.Regardless of who's actually 'right', this has created a significant schism in the entire ecosystem. Curl has a good overview of the state of play  OpenSSL:OpenSSL's approach doesn't work easily in the TLS section for any of the existing QUIC & HTTP/3 implementations. In effect, they've started another column, but with no compatible implementations currently available in the HTTP/3 & QUIC spots.This is a notable issue because for most major projects it would be an enormous & problematic undertaking to drop support for OpenSSL, which effectively means they still cannot ship built-in QUIC support today. Node.js recently briefly discussed even dropping OpenSSL entirely because of this, in favour of BoringSSL or similar, but it's clear that it's not practical: it would be an enormous breaking change, no alternative offers the same levels of long-term support guarantees, and Node and other languages are often shipped in enviroments like Linux distributions where it uses the system's shared OpenSSL implementation, so this would create big headaches downstream too.This is one example of the difference in fundamental pressures of the two tiers of organizations on the web here: open-source tools can't break things like this, and the libraries available to the long-tail are fragmented and uncoordinated. Meanwhile hyperscalers can make decisions quickly and near-unilaterally to set up implementations that work for their environments today, allowing them to get the benefits of new technologies without worrying too much about the state of the open-source common ecosystem for everybody else.I hope this is makes it clear there's a big problem here: underlying organizational differences are turning into a fundamental split in technologies on the Internet. There's an argument that despite the benefits, the long-tail web doesn't  HTTP/3, so they can just ignore it, or use a CDN with built-in support if they really care, and there is no real obligation as such for the hyperscalers to provide convenient implementations to the rest of us just because they want to use some neat new tech between themselves.The problem here though is that there are real concrete benefits to these technologies. QUIC is a significant improvement on alternatives, especially on slow or unreliable mobile internet (e.g. everywhere outside the well-connected offices of the developed world) and when roaming between connections. There are technologies built on top of it, like WebTransport which provides additional significant new features & performance to replace WebSockets. There will be more features that depend on HTTP/3 in future (see how gRPC built on HTTP/2 for example). Again: the technology here is great! But it's a challenge if those benefits are not evenly distributed, and only accessible to a small set of organizations and their customers.Continuing down this road has some plausible serious consequences:In the short term, the long-tail web gains a concerete disadvantage vs the hyperscale web, as HTTP/3 and QUIC makes hyperscale sites faster & more reliable (especially on slow & mobile internet).Other web tools and components (React et al) used by developers either working for hyperscale organizations or building on top of their tools & infra will increase in complexity to match, taking HTTP/3's benefits for granted and moving forwards on that basis, making them less and less relevant to other use cases.If we're not careful, the split between the long-tail & hyperscale cases will widen. New features & tools for each use case will emerge, and won't be implemented by the other, and tooling will increasingly stratify.If hyperscale-only tech is widespread but implementations are not, it becomes increasingly difficult to build tools to integrate with these. Building a Postman-like client for WebTransport is a whole lot harder if you're implementing the protocol from scratch instead of just a UI.You'll start to see lack of HTTP/3 support used as a signal to trigger captchas & CDN blocks, like as TLS fingerprinting is already today. HTTP/3 support could very quickly & easily become a way to detect many non-browser clients, cutting long-tail clients off from the modern web entirely.As all this escalates and self-reinforces, it becomes less & less sensible for the hyperscale side to worry about the long-tail's needs at all, and the ecosystem could stratify completelyAll of that is a way away, and quite hypothetical! I suspect  of this will happen to some degree, but there's a wide spectrum of possibility. It's notable though that this doesn't just apply to HTTP/3: the centralization and coordination of a few CDN & web clients like this could easily play out similarly in many other kinds of technological improvements too.For HTTP/3 at least, I'm hopeful that there will be a happy resolution here to improve on this split in time, although I don't know if it will come soon enough to avoid notable consequences. Many of the external libraries and experimental implementations of QUIC & HTTP/3 will mature with time, and I think eventually (I really really hope) the OpenSSL QUIC API schism will get resolved to open the door to QUIC support in the  OpenSSL-based environments, either with adapters to support both approaches or via a new HTTP/3 & QUIC stack that supports OpenSSL model directly. If you're interested in working on either, and there's anything I can do to help directly or to help fund that work, please get in touch.None of that will happen today though, so unfortunately if you want to use HTTP/3 end-to-end in your application, you may in for a hard time for a while yet.

The idea was simple: let’s build a website where designers and developers could browse, search, and download these icons for their projects.\
The challenge? I had literally zero experience with coding.💀\
Enter Cursor AI, an AI-powered code editor that quickly became my mentor and guide throughout this journey. Here's how I pushed past my limits from design to full-stack with AI assistance and some serious vibe coding.Starting from Ground ZeroThe first step was to establish what I wanted to build and take stock of what I already had:A library of pixel icons in SVG format.A Figma design for the website.A list of features I wanted on the website.Absolutely no idea how to bring it to life.Setting Up the Project with Cursor AI\
After installing Cursor, the next thing was to check for: - for the NPM package\
With the essentials installed, it was time to get my hands dirty. I cloned the repo to my system, opened the project folder in Cursor AI, and initiated a conversation with the built-in AI assistant.Having had a solid experience with Claude, I opted for Claude 3.7 Sonnet in Agent Mode to guide me through the process.\
With the first prompt, I briefly explained what I wanted to build and listed the required features along with a basic structure of the project, asking for suggestions on which framework(s) to prioritize efficiency and speed. Cursor helped with the necessary folder structure and suggested I stick to HTML & Tailwind for the project. It even created the files required for starting the project. Here’s how the folder structure looked after this:The next step was setting up Tailwind & starting with the UI.Setting Up Tailwind CSS & Building The UITo my surprise, Cursor messed up the Tailwind installation and mixed up commands from Tailwind v3.4 & v4.0. So, it was time for me to step up! I went over to Tailwindcss Installation Docs and followed these steps:To install Tailwind, open the terminal & run:npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/cliImport Tailwind in src/style.css file:To set up the Build Process, run:npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./src/style.css -o ./src/output.css --watchStart using Tailwind in the HTML:<link href="/src/output.css" rel="stylesheet">\
Once Tailwind was installed and the classes were ready to be used, I started defining colors, fonts, and other atoms for the AI agent before building out more complex molecules, organisms, and pages as per my Figma Design.\
Then, I installed the Pixel Icon Library NPM Package to use the icons in the project. Here are the steps for installing the NPM Package:npm i @hackernoon/pixel-icon-libraryImport the CSS in your HTML(I moved all the necessary icon font files to the /fonts folder for ease of access.)<link href="/fonts/iconfont.css" rel="stylesheet"><i class="hn hn-icon-name"></i>\
For the UI, I took an element-by-element approach to keep things organized and make it easy to revert to the previous iteration if needed.\
I made sure to define paddings, margins, border radius, colors, and dimensions for all these elements while adding hover & click states as well. In addition to CSS properties, I included responsive behavior & interactions in the prompts as well.:::tip
To generate a preview for all the code I was approving, I used the Live Server extension. This extension launches a local development server with a live reload feature for static & dynamic pages in one click!Icon Data Challenge & Implementing Search FunctionalityWith the UI Elements in place, it was time for the real challenge: displaying all icons with their details - Icon Name, Icon Type Tag, and SVG Code while ensuring smooth search functionality. To overcome this, Cursor suggested a structured approach:Creating a JSON file with icon metadata and SVG codeLoading the data from the JSON to display it efficiently.Implement search based on the icon name.Add search filters based on the icon type tags - solid, regular, brands/social-media-icons, purrcats\
To further automate this process, I asked Cursor to create a script to add all the icon data to the /data/icons.json file.\
Now, with the search working, search filters in place, and icon modal working as intended, all that was left to do was add remaining interactions to the UI, thorough testing, and deployment!Once I was happy with the UI and thoroughly tested every functionality, it was time for the next challenge - Deployment!!!\
Since the project was a static site, I needed a hosting solution that was fast, free, and easy to maintain. GitHub Pages was a no-brainer! It offered:Seamless integration with the GitHub repo, making deployment effortless.It’s free to use & best suited for static projects like this.Updates are super easy - all you need is a commit!\
But before I could push all my code to the repository and deploy via GitHub Pages, I needed to clean up the code and check for any production issues. After a quick back and forth with Cursor, and a few tweaks, it was all ready for launch!\
Here’s all you need to do to deploy your project via GitHub Pages:Push all your code to the GitHub repo & make sure it’s publicEnabling GitHub pages for the repoSet the  to “” (The branch where your code is. In my case, it was in website branch)Add your custom domain (Like I used: pixeliconlibrary.com)Configure DNS (Thanks to Richard for helping me out with this)Wait for a few minutes & your website will be LIVE!From designing pixel-art icons to vibe-coding my way into a fully functional site, this project pushed me beyond my comfort zone in the best way possible. Looking back, it was more than just building a website - it was about widening my creative horizons & realizing that with AI, the line between design and development is blurring faster than ever. And to me, it's like an endless road has opened up in front of my eyes.:::tip
One designer to another: If I can do it, so can you. So, what are you waiting for? Let’s get building!Wanna take a peek at the code behind the website?

Right now I'm still in POC stage, but I’m running one Keycloak client per cluster, each client has two roles (admin and read-only), and users can be admin in some clusters and read-only in others. I am having trouble reconciling the roleBindings and their subjects in a way that feels functionally minimal. The way I see it I end up with either crazy roleBindings, crazy keycloak clients, or an unwieldly number of groups/roles, with some funky mappers thrown in.My questions for you all:How do you handle multi-cluster RBAC when using Keycloak? How do you keep it manageable?Would you stick to the one-client-per-cluster approach, or switch to one client with a bunch of group mappings?If I have to expect it to be messy somewhere, where is better? Keycloak side or k8s side?Would love to hear your setups and any pitfalls you’ve run into!

‘Enough of this. Bring up the railguns, let’s finish this and go home.’ - MCRN Captain Theresa Yao, The Expanse, 2015

Electromagnetic railguns are guns powered by electricity instead of chemical propellants. Most will be familiar with railguns as futuristic weapons featured in science fiction. To date, many countries have carried out experimental and theoretical studies of railguns but none has yet developed them into practical weapons.

The lecture will explore the scientific principles of railgun operation and some of the engineering challenges involved. Derek will also explore some of his experiences from UK experimental work from the 1980s and 1990s, when railguns were seen as potential future anti-tank weapons.

This will include the design and patenting of a railswitch breech for the RARDE experimental programme. He will shed light on the full size wooden model of the patented railswitch breech, now held in the Royal Armouries collection at Fort Nelson (object number XIX.852). He will also talk about his work on the Hyperlocity Test Facility railgun at Culham Laboratory.

In its March 12 quarterly report, the company disclosed it had spent $3.6 million to amend terms on a $200 million Carlyle Group loan from 2023, as U.S. revenue plunged 47% in the fourth quarter. 

"Given these uncertainties and the implication they may have on the Company's financials, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of the issuance of its consolidated 2024 financial statements," the company wrote. 

The robot vacuum pioneer has initiated a formal strategic review after a failed Amazon acquisition, the departure of founder Colin Angle, and layoffs affecting over half its workforce. iRobot cited mounting competition from Chinese manufacturers and expects continued losses for "the foreseeable future."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The 2005 Sony Bravia ad</title><link>https://www.sfgate.com/sf-culture/article/san-francisco-sony-bouncy-ball-ad-20204385.php</link><author>coloneltcb</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:12:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gemini Robotics brings AI into the physical world</title><link>https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/gemini-robotics-brings-ai-into-the-physical-world/</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 15:09:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Introducing Gemini Robotics, our Gemini 2.0-based model designed for roboticsAt Google DeepMind, we've been making progress in how our Gemini models solve complex problems through multimodal reasoning across text, images, audio and video. So far however, those abilities have been largely confined to the digital realm. In order for AI to be useful and helpful to people in the physical realm, they have to demonstrate “embodied” reasoning — the humanlike ability to comprehend and react to the world around us— as well as safely take action to get things done.Today, we are introducing two new AI models, based on Gemini 2.0, which lay the foundation for a new generation of helpful robots.The first is Gemini Robotics, an advanced vision-language-action (VLA) model that was built on Gemini 2.0 with the addition of physical actions as a new output modality for the purpose of directly controlling robots. The second is Gemini Robotics-ER, a Gemini model with advanced spatial understanding, enabling roboticists to run their own programs using Gemini’s embodied reasoning (ER) abilities.Both of these models enable a variety of robots to perform a wider range of real-world tasks than ever before. As part of our efforts, we’re partnering with Apptronik to build the next generation of humanoid robots with Gemini 2.0. We’re also working with a selected number of trusted testers to guide the future of Gemini Robotics-ER.We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop them on the path to real-world applications.Gemini Robotics: Our most advanced vision-language-action modelTo be useful and helpful to people, AI models for robotics need three principal qualities: they have to be general, meaning they’re able to adapt to different situations; they have to be interactive, meaning they can understand and respond quickly to instructions or changes in their environment; and they have to be dexterous, meaning they can do the kinds of things people generally can do with their hands and fingers, like carefully manipulate objects.While our previous work demonstrated progress in these areas, Gemini Robotics represents a substantial step in performance on all three axes, getting us closer to truly general purpose robots.Gemini Robotics leverages Gemini's world understanding to generalize to novel situations and solve a wide variety of tasks out of the box, including tasks it has never seen before in training. Gemini Robotics is also adept at dealing with new objects, diverse instructions, and new environments. In our tech report, we show that on average, Gemini Robotics more than doubles performance on a comprehensive generalization benchmark compared to other state-of-the-art vision-language-action models.To operate in our dynamic, physical world, robots must be able to seamlessly interact with people and their surrounding environment, and adapt to changes on the fly.Because it’s built on a foundation of Gemini 2.0, Gemini Robotics is intuitively interactive. It taps into Gemini’s advanced language understanding capabilities and can understand and respond to commands phrased in everyday, conversational language and in different languages.It can understand and respond to a much broader set of natural language instructions than our previous models, adapting its behavior to your input. It also continuously monitors its surroundings, detects changes to its environment or instructions, and adjusts its actions accordingly. This kind of control, or “steerability,” can better help people collaborate with robot assistants in a range of settings, from home to the workplace.The third key pillar for building a helpful robot is acting with dexterity. Many everyday tasks that humans perform effortlessly require surprisingly fine motor skills and are still too difficult for robots. By contrast, Gemini Robotics can tackle extremely complex, multi-step tasks that require precise manipulation such as origami folding or packing a snack into a Ziploc bag.Finally, because robots come in all shapes and sizes, Gemini Robotics was also designed to easily adapt to different robot types. We trained the model primarily on data from the bi-arm robotic platform, ALOHA 2, but we also demonstrated that it could control a bi-arm platform, based on the Franka arms used in many academic labs. Gemini Robotics can even be specialized for more complex embodiments, such as the humanoid Apollo robot developed by Apptronik, with the goal of completing real world tasks.Enhancing Gemini’s world understandingAlongside Gemini Robotics, we’re introducing an advanced vision-language model called Gemini Robotics-ER (short for ‘“embodied reasoning”). This model enhances Gemini’s understanding of the world in ways necessary for robotics, focusing especially on spatial reasoning, and allows roboticists to connect it with their existing low level controllers.Gemini Robotics-ER improves Gemini 2.0’s existing abilities like pointing and 3D detection by a large margin. Combining spatial reasoning and Gemini’s coding abilities, Gemini Robotics-ER can instantiate entirely new capabilities on the fly. For example, when shown a coffee mug, the model can intuit an appropriate two-finger grasp for picking it up by the handle and a safe trajectory for approaching it.Gemini Robotics-ER can perform all the steps necessary to control a robot right out of the box, including perception, state estimation, spatial understanding, planning and code generation. In such an end-to-end setting the model achieves a 2x-3x success rate compared to Gemini 2.0. And where code generation is not sufficient, Gemini Robotics-ER can even tap into the power of in-context learning, following the patterns of a handful of human demonstrations to provide a solution.Responsibly advancing AI and roboticsAs we explore the continuing potential of AI and robotics, we’re taking a layered, holistic approach to addressing safety in our research, from low-level motor control to high-level semantic understanding.The physical safety of robots and the people around them is a longstanding, foundational concern in the science of robotics. That's why roboticists have classic safety measures such as avoiding collisions, limiting the magnitude of contact forces, and ensuring the dynamic stability of mobile robots. Gemini Robotics-ER can be interfaced with these ‘low-level’ safety-critical controllers, specific to each particular embodiment. Building on Gemini’s core safety features, we enable Gemini Robotics-ER models to understand whether or not a potential action is safe to perform in a given context, and to generate appropriate responses.To advance robotics safety research across academia and industry, we are also releasing a new dataset to evaluate and improve semantic safety in embodied AI and robotics. In previous work, we showed how a Robot Constitution inspired by Isaac Asimov’s Three Laws of Robotics could help prompt an LLM to select safer tasks for robots. We have since developed a framework to automatically generate data-driven constitutions - rules expressed directly in natural language – to steer a robot’s behavior. This framework would allow people to create, modify and apply constitutions to develop robots that are safer and more aligned with human values. Finally, the new ASIMOV dataset will help researchers to rigorously measure the safety implications of robotic actions in real-world scenarios.To further assess the societal implications of our work, we collaborate with experts in our Responsible Development and Innovation team and as well as our Responsibility and Safety Council, an internal review group committed to ensure we develop AI applications responsibly. We also consult with external specialists on particular challenges and opportunities presented by embodied AI in robotics applications.In addition to our partnership with Apptronik, our Gemini Robotics-ER model is also available to trusted testers including Agile Robots, Agility Robots, Boston Dynamics, and Enchanted Tools. We look forward to exploring our models’ capabilities and continuing to develop AI for the next generation of more helpful robots.This work was developed by the Gemini Robotics team.

One of them, a T-55, was 4,700 metres or nearly 3 miles away, four times the battle range of his Challenger 1. When his crew fired the main gun, the round took nearly three full seconds to reach the target. When it did, a massive fireball erupted in the distance. Purbrick’s crew had just achieved the longest tank-to-tank kill in military history. That T-55 was one of many Iraqi tanks which never even saw the enemy coming.

In this third episode of our Gulf War Series IWM Curator Megan Joyce uncovers the challenges faced by Coalition forces, the mass deception tactics employed, and the pivotal role of GPS in navigating the Iraqi desert. Join us as we examine the intense battles, including the Battle of 73 Easting and the Battle of Norfolk, and the final withdrawal of Iraqi troops.

By discussing with several software companies, Kubernetes has emerged as the ideal platform to embrace this paradigm: while it solves many problems, it also introduces significant challenges which I'll try to elaborate a bit more throughout the thread.We all know Kubernetes works (sic) on any infrastructure and (again, sic) hardware by abstracting the underlying environment and leveraging application-centric primitives. This flexibility has enabled a wide range of innovative services, such as:, provided by companies like Kong., exemplified by solutions from EDB., with platforms like OpenShift Virtualization.These services are fundamentally powered by Kubernetes, where an Operator handles the service's lifecycle, and end users consume the resulting outputs by interacting with APIs or Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).This model works well in multi-tenant Kubernetes clusters, where a large infrastructure is efficiently partitioned to serve multiple customers: think of Amazon RDS, or MongoDB Atlas. However, complexity arises when deploying such XaaS solutions on tenants' own environments—be it their public cloud accounts or on-premises infrastructure.This brings us to the concept of : each tenant may require a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for security, compliance, or regulatory reasons (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR, if you're European you should be familiar with it). The result is , where each customer potentially requires multiple clusters. This raises a critical question: who is responsible for the lifecycle, maintenance, and overall management of these clusters?Managed Kubernetes services like AKS, EKS, and GKE can ease some of this burden by handling the Control Plane. However, the true complexity of delivering XaaS with Kubernetes lies in managing multiple clusters effectively.For those already facing the complexities of multi-cluster management (the proverbial  dilemma),  offers a promising solution. By creating an additional abstraction layer for cluster lifecycle management, Cluster API simplifies some aspects of scaling infrastructure. However, while Cluster API addresses certain challenges, it doesn't eliminate the complexities of deploying, orchestrating, and maintaining the "X" in XaaS — the unique business logic or service architecture that must run across multiple clusters.Beyond cluster lifecycle management, additional challenges remain — such as handling diverse storage and networking environments. Even if these issues are addressed, organizations must still find effective ways to:Distribute software reliably to multiple clusters.Perform rolling upgrades efficiently.Gain visibility into logs and metrics for proactive support.Enforce usage limits (especially for licensed software).Simplify technical support for end users.At this stage, I'm not looking for clients but rather seeking a  interested in collaborating to build a new solution from the ground up, as well as engaging with the community members who are exploring or already explored XaaS models backed by Kubernetes and the  (Bring Your Own Cloud) approach. My goal is to develop a comprehensive suite for software vendors to deploy their services seamlessly across multiple cloud infrastructures — even on-premises — without relying exclusively on managed Kubernetes services.I'm aware that companies like Replicated already provide similar solutions, but I'd love to hear about unresolved challenges, pain points, and ideas from those navigating this complex landscape.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Rust Newbies: What mistakes should I avoid as a beginner?

Financial institutions including Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley backed the pledge last year. 

The pledge is nonbinding, but highlights the growing support for expanding nuclear power among leading industries, finance and governments. Amazon, Google and Meta are increasingly important drivers of energy demand in the U.S. as they build out AI centers.

ABSTRACT
An informative guide to what is special about the Rust programming language and how to bring the best parts of it into your software project, whichever programming language it's implemented in.

Rust programmers spend a lot of time thinking about lifetimes, ownership and borrowing. So should you! These concepts are actually universal in programming. Rust's approach is to encode them into the type system and make the compiler check that you're obeying the rules (that you manually check anyway).

We'll also learn about some of its language features, including algebraic data types, error handling, and how it can guarantee that (the equivalent of) a NullPointerExeception will never occur. This language that brings memory safety to systems programming has much to share. Come and learn! [...]

The data was lifted from Allstate's National General business unit, which ran a website for consumers who wanted to get a quote for a policy. That task required users to input a name and address, and once that info was entered, the site searched a LexisNexis Risk Solutions database for data on anyone who lived at the address provided. The results of that search would then appear on a screen that included the driver's license number (DLN) for the given name and address, plus "names of any other drivers identified as potentially living at that consumer's address, and the entire DLNs of those other drivers."
 
Naturally, miscreants used the system to mine for people's personal information for fraud. "National General intentionally built these tools to automatically populate consumers' entire DLNs in plain text -- in other words, fully exposed on the face of the quoting websites -- during the quoting process," the court documents [PDF] state. "Not surprisingly, attackers identified this vulnerability and targeted these quoting tools as an easy way to access the DLNs of many New Yorkers," according to the lawsuit. The digital thieves then used this information to "submit fraudulent claims for pandemic and unemployment benefits," we're told. ... [B]y the time the insurer resolved the mess, crooks had built bots that harvested at least 12,000 individuals' driver's license numbers from the quote-generating site.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Wolf Games, backed by ‘Law &amp; Order’ creator, uses AI to create murder mystery games</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/wolf-games-backed-by-law-order-creator-uses-ai-to-create-murder-mystery-games/</link><author>Lauren Forristal</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Elliot Wolf, the executive producer and son of “Law & Order” creator Dick Wolf, is entering a new venture aimed at engaging true crime fans.  He, along with co-founders Andrew Adashek (CEO) and Noah Rosenberg (CTO), are developing Wolf Games, a new startup that leverages AI to generate daily murder mystery games.

This session is then stored in a browser cookie and sent on every subsequent request, allowing the server to identify the visitor.Now, imagine you are logged into GitHub and there's a session cookie in your browser that's sent with every request to GitHub. What would happen if you visit a website that has this hidden form?="" =""="" ="" =""="" ="" =""The JavaScript code here submits a form that sends a POST request to the  endpoint with two hidden fields:  and . When the form is submitted, the browser detects an existing cookie for the  domain and includes it in the request. This triggers a transfer operation, moving one of your repositories to the attacker's account.This type of attack is known as Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF or XSRF for short), and it can take many forms beyond the example described above. In general, a CSRF attack occurs when an attacker tricks a user into making an unintended request to a trusted website where they are already authenticated. Because the user's session cookie is automatically included in the request, the website processes it as if it were a legitimate action initiated by the user.Secure Cookies Alone Can't Stop CSRF AttacksA secure cookie is one that has the following attributes:http.{
	: ,
	:   ,
	: .,
}Setting  prevents JavaScript from accessing the cookie,  ensures it is only sent over HTTPS, and SameSite: http.SameSiteLaxMode restricts cross-site cookie transmission.You might assume that setting the  cookie attribute is sufficient to prevent cross-site requests. However, this is not always the case. Older browser versions do not consistently enforce this attribute, leaving them vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks. Additionally, clickjacking presents another risk. In this type of attack, an attacker embeds your application inside an invisible iframe and tricks users into clicking buttons or performing actions they didn’t intend. Since these interactions originate from the same domain, they bypass SameSite restrictions, allowing the attacker to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.Lax enforcement provides reasonable defense in depth against CSRF attacks that rely on unsafe HTTP methods (like POST), but does not offer a robust defense against CSRF as a general category of attack. When possible, developers should use a session management mechanism to mitigate the risk of CSRF more completely.This emphasizes that while  provides some protection against CSRF attacks, it is not a complete solution. To fully mitigate the risk of CSRF, we should implement additional session management techniques, with the most common being the use of CSRF tokens.The concept behind CSRF tokens is to establish a shared secret token between the client and the server. When a user first starts a session, the server generates a unique CSRF token and stores it alongside the session data. The server then sends this token to the client in the response. Each time the client makes a POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH request, it must include the CSRF token, typically within the body of the request or in a custom header, which the server verifies by comparing it to the one stored in the token.Now, consider the CSRF attack example we shared earlier:="" =""="" ="" =""="" ="" =""When this form is submitted, the server will detect the missing CSRF token in the body and block the request. If the attacker includes an invalid token, the server will still reject the request upon recognizing that the token doesn't match the session's expected token.In our application HTML template, we may share the token in the response in the form of a hidden field:="" =""
	/** CSRF token field **/
	="" ="" =""="" =""="" =""="" When this form is submitted, the server will validate the CSRF token and allow the request.Alternatively, if we use a JavaScript single page application (SPA), the server may share the CSRF token in a  tag:The client reads it and includes it as a header when submitting a request:: : Finally, some popular JavaScript libraries (like AngularJS and Axios) read the CSRF token from a cookie named . If we include this cookie in the response, the library will read it and send its value back on every request in the form of a  header.Adding CSRF Protection to the Session ManagerBuilding on our previous implementation of a secure session manager in Go, we will now add CSRF protection to the session manager. This involves generating CSRF tokens, storing them in the session, and ensuring they are included with every state-changing request (POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH).To generate a CSRF token, we will add a function that creates a 42-character base64 string with 256 bits of randomness:()  {
	([], )

	, .(., )
	 {
		()
	}

	..()
}Then, we'll ensure that a fresh CSRF token is created with every new session:()  {
	{
		:             (),
		:           []{: ()},
		:      .(),
		: .(),
	}
}Validating the CSRF TokenWe will add a method to the session manager that extracts the CSRF token from a given session and validates it against the  form value or the  header: () (http., )  {
	, .().()
	 {
		
	}

	.()

	 {
		..()
	}

	
}It's important to note that the form field name () and header name () are not fixed and can be customized. Here, I'm using common naming conventions for convenience. However, in your application, you may choose unique, less predictable names to add an extra layer of security.Performing the ValidationIn our session manager's middleware, we will call the  method in the beginning of state-changing requests (POST, PUT, PATCH & DELETE) and fail the request if the token doesn't match what's in the session:........ {

	.(, ) {
		.(, , .)
		
	}

}

.(, )With this setup, any state-changing request will be blocked before reaching the next handler in the chain, preventing an attacker from executing critical business logic.The full code of the  method now looks like this: () ( http.) http. {
	.(( http., http.) {
		, .()

		{
			: ,
			: ,
			:        ,
		}

		.().(, )
		.().(, )

		........ {
			.(, ) {
				.(, , .)
				
			}
		}

		.(, )

		.()

		()
	})
}Using CSRF in the Web ApplicationAs we mentioned earlier, there are multiple ways to pass the CSRF token in the application responses:If the frontend of our application submits typical HTML forms, we may pass the CSRF token down to the template as a template data parameter:.()

.().()

[]{
	: ,
}

.(, )Then, inside our form, we add a hidden field that includes the CSRF token:="" =""="" ="" =""="" In the same way, we may include the CSRF token in a meta tag and read the value via JavaScript if the frontend uses JavaScript to submit forms:="" ="": : Finally, if we're using a JavaScript library that supports the  cookie, we may send that cookie in the handler that presents the SPA view to the browser:.()

.().()

http.{
	:     ,
	:    ,
	:   ,
	: ,
	:     ,
	:   ,
	: .,
}

.(, )Storing the session ID in a secure cookie, which browsers only send for requests originating from the same domain, is an important security measure but is not enough to fully protect users from request forgery. To strengthen security, the token validation pattern presented in this article adds a crucial layer of protection.By incorporating CSRF tokens into session management, we ensure that each request made to the server is not only coming from a trusted origin but also includes a valid token that proves the request was intentionally generated by the user. This pattern helps prevent malicious actors from exploiting session cookies to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The DuckDB Local UI</title><link>https://duckdb.org/2025/03/12/duckdb-ui.html</link><author>xnx</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:56:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[TL;DR: The DuckDB team and MotherDuck are excited to announce the release of a local UI for DuckDB shipped as part of the  extension.The DuckDB CLI provides advanced features like interactive multi-line editing, auto-complete, and progress indicators.
However, it can be cumbersome for working with lengthy SQL queries, and its data exploration tools are limited.
Many of the available third party UIs are great, but selecting, installing, and configuring one is not straightforward.
Using DuckDB through a UI should be as simple as using the CLI.
And now it is!Starting with DuckDB v1.2.1, a full-featured local web user interface is available out-of-the-box!
You can start it from the terminal by launching the DuckDB CLI client with the  argument:You can also run the following SQL command from a DuckDB client (e.g., CLI, Python, Java, etc.):Both of these approaches install the  extension (if it isn't installed yet),
then open the DuckDB UI in your browser:The DuckDB UI uses interactive notebooks to define SQL scripts and show the results of queries.
However, its capabilities go far beyond this.
Let’s go over its main features.The DuckDB UI runs all your queries locally: your queries and data never leave your computer.
If you would like to use MotherDuck through the UI, you have to opt-in explicitly.Your attached databases are shown on the left.
This list includes in-memory databases plus any files and URLs you’ve loaded.
You can explore tables and views by expanding databases and schemas.Click on a table or view to show a summary below.
The UI shows the number of rows, the name and type of each column, and a profile of the data in each column.Select a column to see a more detailed summary of its data.
You can use the  button near the top right to inspect the first 100 rows.
You can also find the SQL definition of the table or view here.You can organize your work into named notebooks.
Each cell of the notebook can execute one or more SQL statements.
The UI supports syntax highlighting and autocomplete to assist with writing your queries.You can run the whole cell, or just a selection,
then sort, filter, or further transform the results using the provided controls.The right panel contains the Column Explorer, which shows a summary of your results.
You can dive into each column to gain insights.If you would like to connect to MotherDuck, you can sign into MotherDuck to persist files and tables to a cloud data warehouse crafted for using DuckDB at scale and sharing data with your team.The DuckDB UI is under active development. Expect additions and improvements!Like the DuckDB CLI, the DuckDB UI creates some files in the  directory in your home directory.
The UI puts its files in a sub-directory, :Your notebooks and some other state are stored in a DuckDB database, .When you export data to the clipboard or a file (using the controls below the results), some tiny intermediate files (e.g. ) are generated.
Your data is cleared from these files after the export is completed, but some near-empty files remain, one per file type.Support for the UI is implemented in a DuckDB extension.
The extension embeds a localhost HTTP server, which serves the UI browser application, and also exposes an API for communication with DuckDB.
In this way, the UI leverages the native DuckDB instance from which it was started, enabling full access to your local memory, compute, and file system.Results are returned in an efficient binary form closely matching DuckDB’s in-memory representation (DataChunk).
Server-sent events enable prompt notification of updates such as attaching databases.
These techniques and others make for a low-latency experience that keeps you in your flow.In this blog post, we presented the new DuckDB UI, a powerful web interface for DuckDB.The DuckDB UI shares many of its design principles with the DuckDB database.
It’s simple, fast, feature-rich, and portable, and runs locally on your computer.
The DuckDB UI extension is also open source: visit the  repository if you want to dive in deeper into the extension's code.The repository does not contain the source code for the frontend, which is currently not available as open-source.
Releasing it as open-source is under consideration.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Linux 6.15 Set To Include Better Handling For Intel P Or E Core Only Mitigations</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.15-P-E-Core-Mitigation</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:46:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A set of patches from Intel for utilizing the CPU type for CPU matching as part of the x86 mitigation handling is likely to be part of the upcoming Linux 6.15 kernel.

Only last month, Washington warned Europe that it would have to take care of its own security in the future.The EU measures will cover goods from the United States worth some 26 billion euros ($40 billion Cdn) — and not just steel and aluminum products. Textiles, home appliances, agricultural goods will be hit with tariffs, as will motorcycles, bourbon, peanut butter and jeans, the latter of which were also taxed during U.S. President Donald Trump's first term.The EU duties aim for pressure points in the U.S. while minimizing additional damage to Europe. The tariffs — taxes on imports — primarily target Republican-held states, hitting soybeans in House Speaker Mike Johnson's Louisiana, and also beef and poultry in Kansas and Nebraska. Produce in Alabama, Georgia and Virginia is also on the list.The European Commission, which manages trade and commercial conflicts on behalf of the 27 EU member countries, said leather goods and agricultural products beyond beef and poultry would be hit, including some seafood, nuts, eggs, sugar and vegetables.Tariffs 'not in our common interest'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement that the bloc "will always remain open to negotiation.""As the U.S. are applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros," she said. "We firmly believe that in a world fraught with geopolitical and economic uncertainties, it is not in our common interest to burden our economies with tariffs."WATCH | Trudeau seeks closer ties, trade with European allies: Trump said his taxes would help create U.S. factory jobs, but von der Leyen said: "Jobs are at stake. Prices will go up. In Europe and in the United States.""We deeply regret this measure. Tariffs are taxes. They are bad for business and even worse for consumers. These tariffs are disrupting supply chains. They bring uncertainty for the economy," she said.The American Chamber of Commerce to the EU said the U.S. tariffs and EU countermeasures "will only harm jobs, prosperity and security on both sides of the Atlantic.""The two sides must de-escalate and find a negotiated outcome urgently," the chamber said Wednesday.A repeat of Trump's 1st termTrump slapped similar tariffs on EU steel and aluminum during his first term in office, which enraged European and other allies. The EU also imposed countermeasures in retaliation at the time.This time, the EU action will involve two steps. First, on April 1, the commission will reintroduce what it calls "rebalancing measures," which the EU had from 2018 and 2020 but were then suspended under the Biden administration.

You need both hands to clap," Sefcovic told reporters at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.European steel companies brace for lossesThe EU could lose up to 3.7 million tons of steel exports, according to the European steel association Eurofer. The U.S. is the second-biggest export market for EU steel producers, representing 16 per cent of the total EU steel exports.The EU estimates that annual trade volume between both sides stands at about $1.5 trillion US, representing some 30 per cent of global trade. While the bloc has a substantial export surplus in goods, it says that is partly offset by the U.S. surplus in the trade of services.Britain, which isn't part of the EU, meanwhile said it won't impose retaliatory measures of its own on the U.S.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Peer-to-peer file transfers in the browser</title><link>https://github.com/kern/filepizza</link><author>keepamovin</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:08:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ditto lands $82M to synchronize data from the edge to the cloud</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/ditto-lands-82m-to-synchronize-data-from-the-edge-to-the-cloud/</link><author>Paul Sawers</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 12:02:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ditto, a company that’s setting out to bring “resilient” connectivity to edge devices, has raised $82 million in a Series B round of funding at a post-money valuation of $462 million, more than double its Series A valuation from 2023. “Edge,” in the context of Ditto’s industry, refers to a distributed computing model that brings […]© 2024 TechCrunch.

You’re reading an interview from ’s Startup Founder Interview Series! Would you like to take a stab at answering some of these questions? The modern spend platform.We originally got our start when we saw no one in our YC cohort could get a corporate card. We realized that the payments industry needed to be shaken up - so we pivoted from our original idea and launched Brex to help founders scale in 2017. \n From there, we realized just how much opportunity existed when it came to how companies manage their spend. Existing tools for planning, spending, and tracking company dollars were antiquated and disconnected, leading to tedious processes for founders and finance teams.\
A fundamental shift was required. That inspired our effort to go beyond just a corporate card and to build an entire platform from the ground up that unified financial services and software, allowing money movement and spend controls to coexist.\
This need to optimize spend is even more relevant in today’s macroeconomic environment, where founders and finance teams are being asked to maximize the ROI of every dollar. We help ensure that they’re equipped to spend smarter and accordingly grow faster.3. What do you love about your team, and why are you the ones to solve this problem?We’ve got a team of builders who are willing to operate with the utmost intensity to build a generational company that exceeds the expectations of our customers. We talk often at Brex about breaking trade-offs between speed and quality. We need to move fast to bring the future we imagine forward, but we never cut corners in that journey. I am insanely proud of how the team approaches this every day, keeping an eye on the big picture but always obsessing about the details. \n The other thing worth noting is that Brex exists at the intersection of financial services and software, and we’ve got an incredible team of experts from both domains (capital markets <> engineers) charting our path forward. The result is that we’ve got the most advanced global capabilities and payment rails in the market, and we’re consistently raising the bar in every product release to make our offering easy to use for smaller companies and customizable at scale for our enterprise customers.4. If you weren’t building your startup, what would you be doing?I truly can’t imagine not building Brex - it is so core to who I am.5. At the moment, how do you measure success? What are your metrics?We look at revenue growth driven by both new customer acquisition and net revenue retention. We also set targets around burn rate, sales efficiency, and CAC paybacks with the goal of 2025 being the last year that Brex burns money.\
Beyond the hard metrics, it is incredibly important to us that our platform can scale. Brex is the only player that can credibly serve companies at every stage of growth, from YC founders starting out to trillion-dollar public companies. We will continue to prioritize this as a core competency - success is serving this wide range of customers for years to come.6. In a few sentences, what do you offer to whom?Brex offers a breadth of products to help businesses spend smarter and make every dollar count including the world’s smartest corporate card with intuitive expense management, banking, bill pay, accounting automation, travel, and more.7. What’s most exciting about your traction to date?We’ve been able to empower companies to make smarter spending decisions at every stage of growth—from startups, to mid-size companies, all the way up to leading, global enterprises like Anthropic, Arm, Robinhood, ServiceTitan, Wiz, and more. We’ve seen companies that began with just two people grow into 1,000+ employee enterprises, and Brex has been there with them every step of the way. It's incredibly rewarding to see how Brex has supported them in scaling efficiently and effectively. With Brex, our customers are saving 169,000 hours per month on expense, documentation, and accounting and customers have a 94% employee compliance rate, compared to the industry standard of 70%.\
But it's not just about providing tools; it's about being a true strategic partner and helping them fuel their exponential growth. That’s the part that truly excites us.8. Where do you think your growth will be next year?2024 was a year of sharp improvement at Brex. Revenue growth accelerated almost 3x this year, net revenue retention is up more than 15 points, while the burn rate is down almost 70%. In 2025, we will continue to compound the momentum built this year, growing faster than 2024 and being the last year in which we burn money — an important milestone to our future IPO. We will also continue to raise the bar on product quality and innovation, while increasing the pace of customer acquisition with healthy unit economics at scale.9. Tell us about your first paying customer and revenue expectations over the next year.Scale AI was Brex’s first customer. I vividly remember Henrique, my co-founder, and I walking to their office and physically handing Alex their Brex card. It’s a moment I’ll never forget.10. What’s your biggest threat?Focus. The central tension of building a company is obsessing over outcomes, but at the same time, not caring about them at all. Ironically, the more you let go of the outcomes and focus on putting out great work, the more the outcomes come. It’s the old adage: the score takes care of itself. All we need to do is to put great work in front of customers, and the score will take care of itself.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Future Is Niri</title><link>https://ersei.net/en/blog/niri</link><author>mattjhall</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:42:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The worst  I have is that I've been using tiling window managers for thirty-five percent of my life: five years with Sway and two with i3. As the realization of those numbers (and my age) dawns upon me, an irresistible urge wells up in my chest, threatening to overwhelm me. I try to tamp it down, but the urge is too strong—I must .This may be worse than finding grey hairs.I switched to Wayland before it was cool, so a lot of stuff was broken, and I got used to it being broken, much like my entire Linux-on-modern-laptop experience. I was  with Sway, since I had gotten used to the workflow over the years. After all, it was what all the  online were using, and I was too young to make good decisions. I went about my life, going through most of high school and all of college with a tiling window manager, dismissing alternatives as straying from the  set forth by anonymous forum-goers.Sway  me (emotionally) with a click-and-drag issue where selecting text and dragging the selection (a pretty bog-standard thing people do with their computers)  somehow to keep the selection happening after you released the mouse.My decades of muscle memory stopped working—I felt lost, adrift on a rough sea, the hot sun bearing down on me. Would I (the bug) ever be rescued (fixed)? Only time would tell, but I was getting desperate.At first, I thought I could handle it and someone would quickly fix the bug. Days turned into weeks, and I was losing my mind. The Sway IRC was silent to my pleads for help, and I had developed a Pavlovian response to clicking on text to highlight it—a burst of panic in my chest as I dread the mouse continuing to drag after I had let go.Naturally, instead of figuring out what library made a breaking change and spending four hours running , I decided to throw nearly a decade of muscle-memory and workflow refinements out the window. I was getting bored of Sway anyway. Let's switch to Niri!For those unaware, Niri is a scrollable-tiling window manager: each workspace is an infinitely-wide strip you can scroll side-to-side on. It's easier to show their official demo video than to try to explain it with words (you don't have to watch the whole thing):It was new, , , and most of all, really cool. I just  to try it, transporting me back to my youth distro-hopping and window-manager-hopping(?) with reckless abandon.It seems to be a recurring theme, throwing myself into a new productivity-altering technology in March when I should be doing more important things instead.It wasn't as bad this time around! Within a few hours, I had a setup that worked fine enough. Within a week, I had Niri working better than Sway, and I was greatly enjoying the changes (read: improvements) it brought.Opening a window does not alter other windows: I can keep my focus and Firefox doesn't scroll to another dimension if I open a terminal in its vicinity.Unlike Sway, Niri supports per-window screensharing, as well as "blackout window from appearing in screen sharing". I've been streaming my homework and it's much nicer without needing to worry about an email notification from my bank showing up in the top corner.Niri has increased my battery life by about two hours compared to Sway.I was so excited about Niri that I tried my hand at adding a feature to its IPC for something or the other, and I greatly enjoyed it! Unlike Sway/wlroots, Niri/Smithay are written in Rust and are surprisingly accessible to hack on.I genuinely can't see myself going back to a traditional tiling window manager, Niri just brings too many improvements to my workflow.The Death of the Traditional Tiling Window ManagerTraditional tiling window managers have a side effect of forcing you to be as efficient as possible with your window layout. There is an additional cognitive load incentivizing you to optimize for the wrong thing: minimizing window reflows. If you don't find yourself constantly swapping between fullscreen and non-fullscreen views and running out of workspaces, you don't have very many windows open. Don't even get me started on tabbed/stacked layouts with nested containers, the least ergonomic Band-Aid™ for the space issue I've ever seen.After many  years of optimizing for the wrong thing with Sway, Niri blesses me with the realization that I can have the speed of a traditional tiling window manager without the space limitations.On Sway, I often had  workspaces open. Ever since I switched to a tiling window manager, I kept running out of space and added shortcuts to workspaces 11-20. I drilled it into myself to close windows when I was done with them, often losing my flow when I come back to the projects I closed, all to save  I feel should be infinite. With Niri, I can have three large projects open, various chat apps, a YouTube video, and three classes worth of schoolwork and never use more than five workspaces. The same setup would have me spilling into workspace  on Sway, and I would quickly get confused and forget where I put my math textbook, switching between each workspace until I find the right one, often the very last one I check!Wow, I did not realize how much repressed anger I had at traditional tiling window managers until now.Given the variety of screen sizes and improved processing power I do not think that the traditional tiling window manager ought to be the power-user workflow of choice. It artificially limits space, forces content reflows, and does not work well with nonstandard monitor layouts.If you are using Sway or another Wayland traditional tiling window manager, you should try Niri. Right now. My configurations are published on Sourcehut if you want to have a Sway-like experience with my keybindings.Go on then, what are you waiting for?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microservices: The Architectural Cult That’s Bankrupting Your Sanity (and Your Startup)</title><link>https://medium.com/mr-plan-publication/microservices-the-architectural-cult-thats-bankrupting-your-sanity-and-your-startup-877e33453785?sk=0d5e112b5ed7b53ea0633f83a9b2c57a</link><author>/u/TerryC_IndieGameDev</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:40:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You’re debugging a payment failure at 2 AM when Slack explodes:“Why is Kubernetes pod #4281 mining Bitcoin?!”As you chug cold coffee, a horrifying realization hits: Your “modern” architecture has become a distributed game of Jenga.

Once completed, it will be the first vessel capable of operating full-time on ammonia, marking a major milestone in efforts to reduce carbon dioxide (CO) emissions in the maritime industry.Industry experts attribute the delay to the complex infrastructure required to handle ammonia safely. “Ammonia is toxic, explosive, and corrosive. We must use special piping, storage tanks, and trucks outfitted with materials engineered to be both leakproof and resistant to ammonia’s corrosive properties,” says John Prousalidis, a professor of marine engineering at the National Technical University of Athens. A spokesperson for Wärtsilä told  that the delay has not been related to performance or safety issues, but to “ the challenges of being at the forefront of maritime decarbonization.” The spokesperson explains that the project “was Being first comes with a set of challenges that must be overcome. One of the biggest environmental concerns with ammonia-powered ships is the potential release of nitrogen oxides. “Instead of CO, which contributes to global warming, we could end up with nitrogen oxides, which are lethal to breathe,” says Prousalidis. “To avoid simply swapping one pollutant for another, ammonia propulsion systems must include emissions-control technologies to prevent harmful nitrogen oxides from entering the atmosphere,” he adds.A promising alternative to combustion engines is ammonia-powered fuel cells like the one originally slated to power the  Fuel cells generate electricity without producing nitrogen oxide emissions. By avoiding combustion entirely, these fuel cells allow ammonia’s nitrogen content to remain in its inert form, eliminating a key health risk.Ammonia Fuel Delays for Despite the challenges, experts believe ammonia could become a mainstream maritime fuel—but not overnight. “Twenty or thirty years ago, the shipping industry made a major shift to natural gas, believing it was the fuel of the future. Now, we know it wasn’t the right step,” says Prousalidis.Looking back at past fuel transitions, he noted that each shift—from steam to oil, and then to natural gas—took around 20 years to achieve full adoption. He expects a similar timeline for the adoption of ammonia or hydrogen. “We need to be patient while persisting in our efforts and not getting discouraged by early challenges.”That perspective aligns with what Equinor’s vice president of renewable and low-carbon technology, Henriette Undrum, told  in 2021 when she urged the public to be patient: “We are not just solving one small problem for one ship. It’s part of the bigger picture. It will be a starting point to build up the market for zero-carbon fuels.”“Seaports are already undergoing an energy transformation,” says Prousalidis. “It would make sense for them to operate as energy hubs—producing, storing, and trading alternative fuels for fuel cells and other power-generation devices.” By doing so, he says, ports could turn a profit while also breaking the stalemate and contributing to global decarbonization efforts.Although concerns about nitrogen oxide emissions remain, companies are reportedly designing post-combustion systems, analogous to the catalytic converters in automobile exhaust systems, to filter out harmful byproducts.  A technique called selective catalytic reduction converts nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water. Ammonia slip catalysts capture unburned ammonia and break it down into the same two inert products. ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>KDE Plasma 6.3.3, Bugfix Release for March</title><link>https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.3.3/</link><author>/u/gabriel_3</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 11:13:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[You can give us feedback and get updates on our social media channels:

Let’s take the example of Zillow, the real-estate marketplace website. This is how their interface looks:It seems pretty simple, which is great. Things become a little complicated when we click on “more“ and see extended form\
 This still doesn’t look complicated. In my opinion, Zillow has a great UI/UX design.\
Many users find filling out multiple filters frustrating and time-consuming. My idea for this article is to provide an option to the user to have it much simpler using AI. Instead of all these fields, we can have only one, where the user can provide a free text, and all those parameters can be extracted from this field. The design for this can look like this:\
This is a good alternative for the complex forms. Yes, the user still needs to write all the details to provide the best match, but it will be much faster than selecting all the fields in the forms.Implementing an AI algorithm can be a challenge and can cost some time/money. But what if we keep the old structure of existing search functionality and just parse the free text into filter fields?\
I got this challenge for one of my clients, and I  am providing you with an adapted version of using OpenAI to do that job:openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "gpt-4-turbo",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a helpful assistant that parses real-estate related text into a strict JSON format. JSON format should be just a simple string without any addition symbols, for example { "property_type": ["house"] }`
    },
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `Parse the following real-estate related text into strict JSON format with the following structure:
        {
          "location": "Extract the mentioned city, neighborhood, or region. Set empty string if none found.",
          "price_range": "Extract the mentioned price range or budget. Return as an object {min: number, max: number}. Set null if none found.",
          "property_type": "Extract the type of property (e.g., apartment, house, studio, condo). Set empty array if none found.",
          "bedrooms": "Extract the number of bedrooms. Set null if none found.",
          "bathrooms": "Extract the number of bathrooms. Set null if none found.",
          "amenities": "Extract key amenities mentioned (e.g., parking, balcony, pool, pet-friendly). Set empty array if none found.",
          "keywords": "Extract any additional keywords relevant to the real estate context. Set empty array if none found."
        }
        Text: "${userFreeTextInput}"`
    }
  ],
  max_tokens: 500
});
\
In this example, I am using the  gpt-4-turbo model, which will return strict JSON that I can use as filters. For an MVP, using OpenAI's API is ideal. However, for a production setting with high traffic, a fine-tuned or self-hosted model may be more cost-effective in the long run. The result of the AI request can be configured to have the same as the user can select in traditional filters UI (first image). We can also improve that by adding exceptions, for example, when the user types something like thisLooking for a 2-bedroom apartment in Texas under $2,500/month, pet-friendly, with a balcony and parking.
I am not considering Austin or Dallas.
\
To exclude specific locations, we modify the JSON structure to include an  key. The AI should extract places users don’t want and store them in an array.{
  "except_location": "Extract the cities, neighborhoods, or regions the user wants to exclude. Set empty array if none found.",
}
\
And here we go with obvious benefits by using AI. The user can even ask to exclude all big cities from the list, and the AI can find all big cities in Texas and does the job.\
Instead of traditional forms, we can give users the  possibility to use a chat, the next level of communication with services. Chat can ask additional questions in case some required information for searching is not found in the free text.\
This is similar to real communication with the agent when users come to the office of the real-estate agency. Having more natural interaction improves user experience.\
Since user preferences are different, I recommend introducing this as a beta option and allowing users to choose their preferred method. In our case, we will run an A/B test comparing AI-powered search against traditional filters. Metrics like time-to-search, conversion rate, and user satisfaction scores will determine which method performs better. In my opinion, in the future, as more people will use AI Chats, they will become more familiar with those types of interfaces and will prefer this option.\
The main benefit of using this approach is that we can simply add voice recognition to the input, and this will look very similar to talking to a real agent. Search results can be easily extended by adding more details to the filters.\
By collecting anonymized user queries, we can analyze patterns and fine-tune a model to provide better recommendations over time.\
I hope this article will help your business to provide your customers with a modern idea of communication.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Haiku OS Wrapping Up Its New malloc &amp; Various Performance Optimizations</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Haiku-OS-New-malloc-More-Perf</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:44:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The BeOS-inspired Haiku open-source operating system project is out with a new monthly progress report to highlight its latest development accomplishments...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Romania hits back after Kremlin criticizes rejection of Georgescu’s candidacy: “Russia hasn’t had free elections for nearly 20 years.

Netflix’s ‘Zero Day’ places viewers in the midst of a massive cyberattack that cripples the United States. With Robert De Niro starring as a former U.S. President investigating the attack, the series explores themes of political intrigue, digital warfare, and the fragility of modern infrastructure. But just how realistic is ‘Zero Day’ from a cybersecurity perspective?\
As a malware research engineer, I watched the show with a critical eye. While some aspects of the cyberattack feel eerily plausible, others stray into sci-fi. Here’s my breakdown of the ‘Zero Day’ where I'll cover three cyber threats that could realistically happen, and three that are pure fiction (at least for now).Three threats that could happenThe series shows several combined attack vectors along with consequences that follow. The main methods include a full-scale attack on critical infrastructure using weaponized malware, as well as a supply chain attack that spreads through fake versions of legitimate software.\
To assess the show’s accuracy, let’s compare these scenarios with real-life cyberattacks.Cyberattack on the critical infrastructure (Colonial Pipeline, 2021)Cybercriminals disrupting essential services is one of the most realistic aspects of ‘Zero Day’. Targeted attacks on power grids, water supplies, and hospitals are not just possible – they are already happening. The 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack shut down one of the largest fuel pipelines in the U.S., leading to gas shortages and widespread panic buying.Weaponized malware (Stuxnet, 2010)The show suggests that a cyber attack could be designed to cripple a nation’s security by sabotaging industrial systems. In reality, malware infection of critical systems have influenced global geopolitics for years. A historical precedent is Stuxnet, a highly sophisticated cyber weapon used to damage Iran’s nuclear centrifuges.\
Stuxnet closely resembles the attack shown in the series, especially since it also caused physical damage to infrastructure. This type of malware functions like a worm, crawling through networks, spreading across devices, and causing failures in software or hardware — remaining persistent for long periods. We can only imagine the dire consequences if such a worm used AI to adapt to its environment.Supply chain attack (NotPetya, 2017)‘Zero Day’ suggests that an attack could rapidly spread through interconnected systems — a scenario that is entirely plausible. Today, a single compromised vendor in a supply chain can infect thousands of organizations. Our team  many similar attack techniques while analyzing fake software bundled with stealer implants, tricking users into believing they were using legitimate programs.\
One of the most devastating cyberattacks in history, NotPetya, spread through a compromised update for widely used software in Ukraine, causing billions of dollars in damages worldwide.Three threats that are far from realityNetflix excels at storytelling, which is why its shows are so captivating. However, here’s how Zero Day dramatizes hacking for suspense.Instant and simultaneous system collapseIn ‘Zero Day’, the cyberattack appears to take down everything at once — financial markets, emergency services, transportation. While coordinated attacks are possible, real-world cyberattacks don’t usually spread with such precision. Attacks like NotPetya or SolarWinds took time to propagate, and organizations reacted at different speeds.“If we're talking about a common vulnerability, it would likely be in the baseband or hardware. But with multiple vendors supplying critical infrastructure across the country, this remains unrealistic for now,” notes Senior Reverse Engineer at MacPaw’s Moonlock (who chose to remain anonymous).Total control with a few keystrokes'Zero Day' relies on a classic Hollywood trope — a hacker typing furiously in a dark room, instantly causing systems to crash like dominoes. In reality, cyberattacks take weeks, months, or even years to prepare. Breaching critical infrastructure requires intricate social engineering, vulnerability hunting, lateral movement, and stealth to evade detection. It’s never as simple as hitting a few keystrokes and watching the world burn.The unstoppable supervirusThe show portrays an unstoppable cyber weapon with no way to mitigate its effects. It's true that advanced malware can be highly persistent, but no cyberattack is truly unpatchable. Even the most destructive malware can be taken down with countermeasures, whether through endpoint protection, network segmentation, or manual intervention. The notion "once it’s launched, it’s game over" is pure fiction.“If the goal is to find vulnerabilities in an infected system, fuzzers are used. They run non-stop on CI servers. But instead of brute-forcing all possible values, they rely on smart mutations. Moreover, not every crash dump leads to an exploitable vulnerability. And to even operate on an infected system in the first place, you’d already need a vulnerability to execute code. So, you've got something like a time loop in ‘Terminator’. Therefore, I’d say these scenarios aren’t plausible with the current state of AI development,” adds Senior Reverse Engineer at MacPaw’s Moonlock.While 'Zero Day' takes creative liberties, some of its fictional elements could eventually become real. Advancements in AI-driven attacks, deepfake social engineering, and autonomous malware may one day bring us closer to the threats depicted in the show. AI-assisted hacking tools are already reshaping the threat landscape, making cyberattacks faster and more efficient.\
For example, Moonlock Lab’s team recently discovered  that uses the OpenAI API (ChatGPT) to run phishing campaigns. While the AI still requires well-structured queries to generate personalized phishing content, it significantly simplifies and accelerates the work of threat actors.\
Moreover, as governments and nation-state actors invest in cyber warfare, the line between fiction and reality continues to blur. AI-driven disinformation campaigns, automated zero-day exploits, and self-spreading malware are no longer far-fetched scenarios. However, at this stage, threat actors primarily use AI for automation and attack preparation — not ==‘using AI to adapt the code in the process of execution’,== as seen in the series.Fiction as a cautionary taleThe ‘Zero Day’ series may exaggerate some elements of cyber warfare, but it effectively highlights an important truth — our digital infrastructure is vulnerable. While we may not see a Hollywood-style ‘doomsday virus’ anytime soon, real-world threats like ransomware, critical infrastructure attacks, and AI-driven cybercrime demand our attention and awareness.\
As malware researchers, security professionals, and even everyday users, we should learn from both real-world incidents and fictional warnings. Cyber threats are evolving, 'Zero Day' just accelerates the timeline. \n ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Jonathan Riddell Stepping Down From KDE Plasma Release Management</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Riddell-Stepping-Down-Plasma-RM</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:18:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Longtime KDE developer who has served with Plasma release management duties, KDE Neon operating system development, and former Kubuntu release manager, among other roles, announced he will be stepping down from his Plasma release management duties...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Salesforce to invest $1B in Singapore to boost adoption of AI</title><link>https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/12/salesforce-to-invest-1b-in-singapore-to-boost-adoption-of-ai/</link><author>Kate Park</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 10:12:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Salesforce plans to invest $1 billion in Singapore over the next five years as it seeks to fuel the adoption of its AI agent development platform, Agentforce.

Data transformation and discretization are critical steps in the data preprocessing pipeline. They prepare raw data for analysis by converting it into forms suitable for mining, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data mining algorithms. This article dives deep into the concepts, techniques, and practical applications of data transformation and discretization.Data transformation involves converting data into appropriate forms for mining. This step is essential because raw data is often noisy, inconsistent, or unsuitable for direct analysis. Common data transformation strategies include:: Remove noise from the data (e.g., using binning or clustering).: Create new attributes from existing ones (e.g., area = height × width).: Summarize data (e.g., daily sales → monthly sales).: Scale data to a smaller range (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0).: Replace numeric values with intervals or conceptual labels (e.g., age → "youth," "adult," "senior").Concept Hierarchy Generation: Generalize data to higher-level concepts (e.g., street → city → country).: Removes noise, inconsistencies, and redundancies.Enhances Mining Efficiency: Reduces data volume and complexity, speeding up algorithms.Facilitates Better Insights: Transforms data into forms that are easier to analyze and interpret.Normalization scales numeric attributes to a specific range, such as [0.0, 1.0] or [-1.0, 1.0]. This is particularly useful for distance-based mining algorithms (e.g., k-nearest neighbors, clustering) to prevent attributes with larger ranges from dominating those with smaller ranges.3.1.1 Min-Max Normalizationv*’* : Original value of the attribute.min⁡A ​: Minimum value of attribute .max​: Maximum value of attribute .new_min​: Minimum value of the new range (e.g., 0.0).new_max​: Maximum value of the new range (e.g., 1.0).Suppose the attribute "income" has a minimum value of $12,000 and a maximum value of $98,000.We want to normalize an income value of $73,600 to the range [0.0, 1.0].The normalized value is .3.1.2 Z-Score NormalizationSuppose the mean income is $54,000 and the standard deviation is $16,000.We want to normalize an income value of $73,600.The normalized value is .3.1.3 Decimal Scaling Normalizationj : Smallest integer such that ( max(|v'|) < 1 ).Suppose the attribute "price" has values ranging from -986 to 917.The maximum absolute value is 986.The smallest integer ( j ) such that ( 986 / 10^j < 1 ) is  j = 3 .The normalized value is .Discretization replaces numeric values with interval or conceptual labels. This is useful for simplifying data and making patterns easier to understand.Binning divides the range of an attribute into bins (intervals). There are two main types:Divide the range into ( k ) equal-width intervals.Example: For the attribute "age" with values [12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 30, 35, 40], create 3 bins:Divide the range into ( k ) bins, each containing approximately the same number of values.Example: For the same "age" values, create 3 bins:Histograms partition the values of an attribute into disjoint ranges (buckets). The histogram analysis algorithm can be applied recursively to generate a multilevel concept hierarchy.For the attribute "price" with values [1, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 10, 10, 10, 10, 12, 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 18, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 21, 21, 21, 25, 25, 25, 25, 28, 28, 30, 30, 30]:Create an equal-width histogram with a bin width of $10:3.2.3 Cluster, Decision Tree, and Correlation AnalysesGroup similar values into clusters and replace raw values with cluster labels.Example: Cluster "age" values into "young," "middle-aged," and "senior."Use decision trees to split numeric attributes into intervals based on class labels.Example: Split "income" into intervals that best predict "credit risk."Use measures like chi-square to merge intervals with similar class distributions.Example: Merge adjacent intervals if they have similar distributions of "purchase behavior."3.3 Concept Hierarchy Generation for Nominal DataConcept hierarchies generalize nominal attributes to higher-level concepts (e.g., street → city → country). They can be generated manually or automatically based on the number of distinct values per attribute.For the attributes "street," "city," "province," and "country":Sort by the number of distinct values:Country (15) → Province (365) → City (3567) → Street (674,339).Country → Province → City → Street.4. Practical Applications: Normalize income and age attributes to cluster customers into segments.: Discretize purchase amounts into intervals to identify patterns.: Use concept hierarchies to generalize transaction locations (e.g., street → city → country).Data transformation and discretization are essential steps in data preprocessing. They improve data quality, enhance mining efficiency, and facilitate better insights. By normalizing, discretizing, and generating concept hierarchies, you can transform raw data into a form that is ready for analysis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Wants to Fix Your Network Before It Breaks—But Can You Trust It?</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-wants-to-fix-your-network-before-it-breaksbut-can-you-trust-it?source=rss</link><author>Anna Naumova</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:52:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Not that long ago, the experience in managing networks and data centers was one of humans doing the effort, as admins entered commands, configured routers, balanced loads, and hunted down outages. Fast forward to today, and the AI revolution is a game changer — automating fast decision-making, predicting failures before vibrations cause them, and optimizing infrastructure in ways that humans never could.\
But how much of this is real? And how much is simply marketing hype?\
Slicing it—and slicing it again—let’s take a look at AI in networks and data centers today, who’s using it and where it makes a difference, as well as what it needs to do better.Network management has traditionally been a reactive job. Something breaks? An engineer fixes it. Latency spikes? Someone troubleshoots it. However, AI-enabled networking is moving us away from the reactive firefighting and toward the proactive self-healing system.Artificial Intelligence Is Redefining Networking.Traffic Optimization Automatically: AI-driven SD-WANs and intent-based networking systems allow bandwidth to be dynamically provisioned, traffic routed dynamically, and loads balanced across data centers, in real time, based on current demand. ML algorithms can be trained on historical network data that assist AI in predicting hardware failures (e.g. switches, routers, fiber links) before they happen, minimizing failures and downtime that can be expensive.Anomaly Detection & Security: AI can spot anomalous traffic patterns that might indicate a cyberattack, misconfiguration, or insider threat — all common occurrences that traditional rule-based systems tend to miss. Artificial intelligence (AI) — based network monitoring tools dynamically prioritize traffic based on real-time business needs, followed by ensuring that data-heavy applications can get precedence over other not-so-important traffic.🏢 AI and the Data Center of the FutureSo, modern data centers are a logistical hellscape — you’re managing power, cooling, security, storage, compute, and network, all at the same time. AI is coming to optimize everything to efficiency, scale, and autonomy.Data Centers Are Getting Smarter Thanks to AI.Cooling Optimization & Energy Efficiency: AI reads on temperature, load distribution, and airflow to passively adjust the cooling power accordingly, which reduces power consumption. (One industry example: Google cut its data center cooling costs to 40% by adopting DeepMind AI.)Smart Resource Allocation: This includes workload orchestration with AI, which can intelligently distribute workloads of jobs over multiple servers to decrease resource waste and increase efficiency. Predictably, Artificial Intelligence, on the other hand, makes possible scaling that is at a granular level as opposed to a resource allocation of fixed resources, significantly reducing waste of power and cost.Self-Healing Infrastructure: And AI detects early-stage hardware degradation before faults occur and initiates proactive mitigation (e.g., moving workloads from nodes in failure). Hyperscalers are experimenting with replacing hardware with AI-driven robotics.Automatic Service Establishment: AI coordinates what are often complex, parallel changes to the network so that if many changes are needed, then less human labor is involved and the changes get deployed faster. Business intent-based configuration of BGP peering, VLAN tagging, or cloud interconnects instead of scripts by hand is done via AI for example.🏙️The Significance of Edge AI in Networking and Data Center EnvironmentsAs AI workloads are on the hike, putting everything on the cloud is no more a smart option. Enter edge computing.Why AI is Moving to the Edge. Processing AI workloads closer to the user results in timely decisions — autonomous vehicles, industrial robotics, smart cities, etc. Not every application requires returning the data to a centralized data center — edge AI performs this task locally. Applications like security, fraud detection, and machine vision are all AI-powered and must respond in real time, so tasks at the edge are ideal. Tesla’s Autopilot doesn’t stream raw video to a cloud data center—its on-device edge AI processes it in the moment.How Networks Need to Adapt.Provision of high-speed low-latency connections between devices, edge nodes, and central data centers is AI at the Edge. 5G and next-gen networking is going to play a huge role in making AI-enabled edge computing practical.🛑 AI is NOT the Solution: Challenges and RisksAnd even while AI is coming to revolutionize networking and data centers, it’s not a sure thing. Here are some of the most significant roadblocks:AI Still Needs Quality Data. AI models are only as good as the data they’re trained on. So garbage data = garbage predictions. AI-based Network Monitoring has too many false positives, where normal traffic is flagged as an anomaly. AI-powered automation can occasionally introduce an additional level of complexity, and so that when things go awry, it’s even harder for engineers to diagnose the problem. “AI misconfiguration” is a real threat — perhaps an AI auto-optimizes a network that somehow adds congestion. Attackers are already leveraging adversarial attacks to evade security systems powered by AI. A poorly trained AI could even create new vulnerabilities instead of shutting them down.🔮 How AI Will Change Networks and Data CentersWe aren’t there just yet — not fully at the AI-driven, self-optimizing network/data center — but we are moving in that direction. Some trends to watch: Companies like Juniper, Cisco, and Arista are using AI-native network controllers so you don’t even have to adjust anything by hand.AI-Optimized Networking Chips: Custom AI accelerator chips will pinpoint packet routing and conduct deep packet inspection faster than ever before.AI for Carbon-Neutral Data Centers: Look for carbon-aware AI scheduling—to move workloads to the server farms with the greenest energy mix in real time.AI is helping networks and data centers to be more clever, speedy, and efficient.\
Self-optimizing fabric networks, AI-powered cooling, and predictive maintenance are just some of the ways the industry is working towards fully autonomous infrastructure.\
But AI is not a cure-all — bad data, hard-to-reduce errors, and security risks all need human supervision.\
 AI-driven networking architecture, AI-first chipsets, true self-healing.What impact will there be from AI on networking and data centers in the future?\

How can we compress and transfer knowledge from a bigger model or ensemble of models(which were trained on very large datasets to extract structure from data) to a single small model without much dip in performance?\
But why do we want to do this? Why we need a smaller model when a bigger model or ensemble model is already giving great results on test data?\
At training time we typically train large/ensemble of models because the main goal is to extract structure from very large datasets. We could also be applying many things like dropout, data augmentation at train times to feed these large models all kinds of data.\
But at prediction time our objective is totally different. We want to get results as quickly as possible. So using a bigger/ensemble of models is very expensive and will hinder deployment to large number of users. So, now the question is how can we compress knowledge from this bigger model into a smaller model which can be easily deployed.\
Geoffrey Hinton, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean from google through theirpaper came up with a different kind of training called  to transfer this knowledge to the smaller model. This is the same technique that hugging face used in their Distill BERT implementation.\
If we can train this smaller model to  in the same way as a large model, then this smaller model trained this way will do much better than the smaller model trained on the same data but in the normal way. This is one of the  principles behind DistillationUsually, in Machine learning, a model that learns to discriminate between a large number of classes, the main training objective is to maximize the average log probability of correct answer. For example, take the example of the MNIST dataset where the goal is to classify an image as to whether it’s 1 or 2 or … 9. So if the actual image is 2 then the objective of any model is to maximize  (which can be read as probability that a particular image is 2 given the image). But the model also gives probabilities to all incorrect answers even though those probabilities are very small, some of them are much larger than others. Point is that even though these probabilities are small, relative probabilities of incorrect answers tell us a lot about how the model can generalize. To understand it, let’s have a look at the below example.\
In the above figure, this version of 2 was given a probability of 10-6 of being a 3 and 10-9 of being a 7 whereas for another version it may be the other way around. This is valuable information that defines a rich similarity structure over the data(i. e. it says which 2’s look like 3’s and which look like 7’s) but it has very little influence on the cross-entropy cost function during the transfer stage because the probabilities are so close to zero.\
But before we move on to the distillation procedure, let’s spend time on how the model actually produced output probabilities. This is where softmax activation comes in. Last step of model processing is softmax and this component is what gives output probabilities. Input to softmax is called logits and we design the final layer of NN in such a way that number of hidden units = number of classes we want to classify.The formula for calculating softmax is given asThe above equation gives probabilities for each  and the sum of all probabilities overall  equals 1. During training time, loss for any single training example is calculated by comparing these softmax probabilities with hard targets(labels) and using backpropagation coefficients are updated until the loss is minimum.\
As seen above this softmax gives a high probability to a true label and low probabilities to incorrect labels. We also see that probabilities of incorrect answers even though small, have lot of information hidden in them which helps the model to generalize. We call this 3. Distillation ProcedureAccording to the paper, the best way to transfer generalization capabilities of the larger model to a small model is to use class probabilities produced by the cumbersome model as  for training the small model.\
So the process is as follows:Take the original training set which was used to train the bigger model then pass that training data through the bigger model and get softmax probabilities over different classes. As seen above, true label will get high probability and incorrect labels will get low probabilities. But we saw these low probabilities have a lot of information hiding in them. So to magnify importance of these probabilities authors of the papers used a variable called Temperature(T) to divide all logits before passing through softmax. This produces a softer probability distribution over classes. We can see below\
The output of applying softmax with temperature(T) is what we call Soft targets. This process is what authors called. Analogy with removing impurities in water by increasing temperatureMuch of information about learned function from large model resides in the ratios of very small probabilities in the soft targets. - output from the large model after temperature T has been applied during softmax - output from the smaller model after temperature T has been applied during softmax - output from smaller model when temperature T = 1(regular softmax) - actual targets from training set\
Below is a flowchart of the entire training process\
So training process for a small model has 2 loss functions. The first loss function takes both soft predictions and soft targets and is the cross-entropy loss function. This is the way generalization ability is transferred from large model to small model by trying to match soft targets. For this loss function, both softmax uses the temperature of ‘T’.\
Authors also found that using the small model to match true targets helps. This is incorporated in the second cost function. The final cost is a weighted average of these two cost functions with hyper-parameters alpha and beta.The authors used the MNIST dataset to test this approach. They used two architectures for this which differs only in the number of hidden units in middle layers. The authors used 2 hidden layer neural network in both casesSmaller model which can be viewed as 784 -> 800 -> 800 -> 10 (where 784 is unrolled dimensions of an image, 800 is the number of hidden units with RELU activation and 10 is the number of classes we are predicting). This model gave 146 test errors with no regularization.Bigger model which can be viewed as 784 -> 1200 -> 1200 -> 10 (where 784 is unrolled dimensions of an image, 1200 is the number of hidden units with RELU activation and 10 is the number of classes we are predicting). This model is trained on MNIST using dropout, weight-constraints, and jittering input images and this net achieved 67 test errors.\
Can we transfer this improvement in the bigger model to a small model?\
Authors now used both soft targets obtained from the big net and true targets without dropout and no jittering of images i.e, the smaller net was regularized solely by adding the additional task of matching soft targets produced by the large net at a temperature of 20 and the result is. using 784 -> 800 -> 800 -> 10\
This shows that soft targets can transfer a great deal of knowledge to the small model, including the knowledge about how to generalize that is learned from translated training data. In other words, the benefit we got from transforming inputs transfers across to the little net even though we are not transforming inputs for the small net.\
It’s well-known fact that transforming inputs by different transformations make the model generalize much better and in our case information about how to  is showing up in Dark knowledge and this is hiding in soft targets. None of this information is in True targets. So by using information from soft targets our small net is performing much better.Big net using soft targets learned similarity metric that learned ‘what’s like what’ and with this knowledge transfer, we are telling the little net ‘what’s like what’\
All of above experiment on MNIST is summarized below5. Additional experiment on MNISTIn addition, authors also tried omitting examples of digit 3 when training a smaller model using distillation. So from the perspective of the small model, 3 is a mythical digit that it has never seen. Since the smaller model has never seen 3 during training, we expect it to make a lot of errors when encountering 3 in the test set. Despite this, the distilled model only made 206 test errors of which 133 are on 1010 threes in the test set. This clearly shows that generalization capabilities of the large model were transferred to the small model during distillation and this causes the small model to correctly predict 3 in most cases\
So moral of the story is.Transforming input images greatly improves generalization. Transforming the targets also has a similarly large effect and if we can get soft targets from somewhere it’s much cheaper as we can get the same performance with the smaller modelHinton, Geoffrey, Oriol Vinyals, and Jeff Dean. “Distilling the knowledge in a neural network.”Knowledge distillation by intellabs.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>‘I feel utter anger’: From Canada to Europe, a movement to boycott US goods is spreading | Trump administration</title><link>https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/12/i-feel-utter-anger-from-canada-to-europe-a-movement-to-boycott-us-goods-is-spreading</link><author>/u/ExtremeOccident</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:40:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Train hijack: Who are the Balochistan Liberation Army and what do they want? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_4JlUmhhjY</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/M_4JlUmhhjY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:30:16 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Pakistani security officials say 155 train passengers taken hostage by separatist militants have now been freed.

Most people agree on that. With well-executed PR, a business can reach new heights, expand its horizons, build audience loyalty, and strengthen trust. But it’s just as easy to mess things up if handled incorrectly.Let’s start with the fact that I’m generally against this kind of opposition, even though it’s very common. "We have our own team," "We’d rather hire an in-house PR person," "We do everything ourselves"—these are frequent comments.\
But here’s an obvious analogy. If you need to sell your product, do you hire a traveling salesman, hand him a suitcase with product samples, put him in a cart, and send him off to knock on doors? Of course not. You hire a team of salespeople, provide them with mailing services, landing pages, lead generators, analytics, and so on. Can a salesperson sell on their own? Yes. Will their efficiency increase if you create the right environment? Absolutely. The same applies to PR.\
Looking at trends in integrating PR into businesses, let’s examine how Russian IT companies—technological flagships of the economy—implement this. Previously, we  that 17% of companies significantly expanded their PR teams. More than 50% of companies want to strengthen their marketing units by involving PR agencies. This indicates that the sector understands that they can’t survive without PR reinforcements.Sometimes, companies have both in-house specialists and external partners working together towards results. Of course, situations vary, and it’s not always about budget constraints. Let’s break this down neatly.Pros and Cons of Each OptionThe most obvious advantage of an in-house PR specialist: they’re all yours. Always available, and not strictly limited by a contract (just check PR job listings on HH.ru—there’s a ton of responsibilities). You can assign them anything! And they will do something. All for one salary! Whether they have the time, expertise, or resources to do everything effectively is another question.\
An in-house PR person is deeply immersed in the business and knows it better than anyone else. That’s a unique asset. But there are two nuances:When will they have time to work with the external world if they’re always learning about the product and engaging with internal business structures?Everyone knows that if you stay in one environment too long, you lose objectivity, start seeing customers through your own lens, and lose critical perspective on the product and business.\
An in-house PR person might embark on a vague quest, given ambiguous tasks like "figure something out." If management isn’t clear on what they want, they hire someone, vaguely outline a task, and then oversee execution with a "seagull management" approach—flying in occasionally to check progress. No news? "Make something up. Walk around the factory, talk to smart people, follow the director for two days and write down their ideas—that’s what we pay you for!" Agencies don’t work like that.\
And here’s the kicker—lack of mandatory results is compensated by cost savings. One salary. But this advantage diminishes if there’s a whole PR team, in which case costs become comparable to those of an agency, where a team also works on your project.Should you then hire an agency? Not so fast—there’s more to consider.\
Agencies have more resources. They handle multiple clients, have broader experience, stronger connections, and more data to understand target audiences and markets. However, agencies must work closely with clients since they lack in-depth product knowledge and internal access. There’s an adjustment period to fine-tune collaboration.\
Agencies are results-driven, working with deadlines and specific metrics—what, how much, and how effectively. Sounds great, but only if the client knows what results they want and is ready to cooperate—approving materials, providing information, and answering questions promptly. If not, an agency can become an annoying force constantly demanding input to meet deadlines.\
Agencies are skilled but don’t like doing much beyond the contract’s scope. At some point, additional costs may arise—especially when a client gets excited and wants more.\
Good work costs money. Not astronomical amounts, but agencies are always pricier than a single in-house PR specialist. However, if the in-house team grows beyond one person, costs become comparable.\
Finally, working with an agency can be daunting—not because they bite, but because they make publicity a reality. Suddenly, people will read about your business, discuss it, scrutinize it. What if something doesn’t work well or look good enough? This fear of public exposure is more common among business owners than you’d think.A global study shows that brands outsource the following to agencies:Pitching to journalists (78% of companies)Revising or building media lists (73%)Project work for product launches (51%)Content creation, including blogs (39%)\
Additionally, businesses often hire multiple agencies for different tasks.The best approach, if circumstances allow, is a PR team strengthened by a professional agency. Alternatively, an in-house PR manager overseeing a partner agency can be effective. This mix optimally distributes resources, workload, and ensures measurable, predictable results.But if you have to choose one? Here’s how to decide.Process matters more than results. Social media is managed, texts are written, publications happen, and requests come in. Ambitious growth may be tough, but for some, that’s enough.You value internal knowledge. The in-house PR person understands your business deeply, maintains great internal relationships, and keeps communications smooth.You prefer a slow and steady approach. If there are no major growth ambitions and no clear promotional plans, an in-house PR specialist is a solid, cost-effective solution.You operate in a competitive market. Quick, well-planned PR actions are crucial, and predicting their consequences requires expertise and resources.You have ambitious growth plans. PR enhances audience interaction, speeds up decision-making, builds loyalty, and creates brand ambassadors. A well-known brand has at least a 30% higher selection probability over an unknown but identical product.You don’t have (or plan to build) an in-house PR team. Many business owners prefer to delegate processes outside their expertise to professionals, making agency selection critical.\
Some might argue: "What about companies with full-scale in-house PR teams?" Yes, having an in-house team is strategically sound. But look at major players—they have plenty of partners, including agencies. Strength lies in diversification.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What′s new in Java 24</title><link>https://pvs-studio.com/en/blog/posts/java/1233/</link><author>/u/Xaneris47</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 09:17:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Programming</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[On March 18, a new Java version is set to arrive! Let's take a peek at new features, including the long-awaited final implementation of Stream Gatherers!The order of the JEPs (JDK Enhancement Proposal) presented here is based on our assessment of their "interestingness" rather than their official numbering.JEP 485: Stream GatherersAs you know, Stream API operations are divided into  operations that generate a new  and  operations that create a result or have a side effect. However, terminal operations have , which allows us to create custom operations via the  implementation. The set of intermediate ones has only , , , , , , and . That's the case—until Java 24, which introduces .The key points of the new feature are as follows:1. New  method added to .2. New java.util.stream.Gatherer interface, which consists of four methods: creates an initial intermediate state using ; handles elements, optionally uses the intermediate state, and sends results further down the stream. It relies on the new  functional interface. merges states using ; performs on the intermediate state and sends the result further down the stream after all elements have been processed. It uses .3. New java.util.stream.Gatherers class, which provides several standard implementations of : is similar to the  operation; performs incremental accumulation; is a standard implementation of Fixed Window; is a standard implementation of Sliding Window.The Sliding Window technique creates a window of the N size over the input data and then shifts that window. A simple example with a number array and a window size of 3 illustrates this concept:The result of this operation is  containing all the subarrays highlighted by the blue frame.With Gatherers, we can easily output all subarrays as follows:public static void main(String[] args) {
    var list = List.of(
        "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", 
        "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14"
    );
    int k = 3;

    list.stream()
        .gather(Gatherers.windowSliding(k))
        .forEach(sublist -> System.out.printf("%s ", sublist));
    System.out.println();
}[1, 2, 3] [2, 3, 4] [3, 4, 5] [4, 5, 6] [5, 6, 7] [6, 7, 8] [7, 8, 9] [8, 9, 10] [9, 10, 11] [10, 11, 12] [11, 12, 13] [12, 13, 14]Fixed Window has a similar implementation—except that the shift is equal to the window size.The usage remains the same:public static void main(String[] args) {
    var list = List.of(
        "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
        "8", "9", "10", "11", "12", "13", "14"
    );
    int k = 3;

    list.stream()
        .gather(Gatherers.windowFixed(k))
        .forEach(sublist -> System.out.printf("%s ", sublist));
    System.out.println();
}[1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6] [7, 8, 9] [10, 11, 12] [13, 14]In addition to creating custom classes that implement , Java provides static factory methods:Gatherer.ofSequential(integrator)Both methods have variations with different additional arguments in the form of functional interfaces—, , , and —which were mentioned earlier.A custom API to work with class files was introduced in JDK 22. Now, with JDK 24, this API has been finalized!The rapid Java development in recent years has led to frequent and regular bytecode updates with which standard tools like , , and others interact. They use libraries like ASM for this interaction. To support new bytecode versions, tools should wait for library updates—yet libraries, in turn, wait for the final implementation of new JDK versions. This dependency chain slows down the development and adoption of new class file features.While this API may not be directly useful for most developers, it's essential for various frameworks and libraries—including Spring and Hibernate—that work with bytecode and use ASM. The problem is that older ASM versions are incompatible with newer JDK releases. If we need to update the JDK version in a project, ASM must be updated as well—so, we need to update everything that depends on it... well, almost everything. Yet we just wanted to upgrade the JDK version.Let's explore a new API. After experimenting with it, we've put together a simple example that reads static constant primitive fields (a basic understanding of class-file structures is required):public class ClassFileExample {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    var classFile = ClassFile.of().parse(Path.of("./Main.class"));

    for (var field : classFile.fields()) {
      var flags = field.flags();
      if (flags.has(AccessFlag.STATIC) && flags.has(AccessFlag.FINAL)) {
        System.out.printf("static final field %s = ", field.fieldName());
        var value = field.attributes().stream()
          .filter(ConstantValueAttribute.class::isInstance)
          .map(ConstantValueAttribute.class::cast)
          .findFirst()
          .map(constant -> constant.constant().constantValue().toString())
          .orElse("null");
        System.out.printf("%s%n", value);
      }
    }
  }
}This can be surprisingly helpful because reflection leads to class initialization. One day, we might delve into the consequences of such  initialization.Developers familiar with ASM may notice that the authors chose not to use the  pattern because of Java's new features, particularly pattern matching.JEP 483: Ahead-of-Time Class Loading & LinkingThis new feature aims to streamline application loading time. To achieve this, Java now enables caching of loaded classes. The process of generating and using this cache consists of three steps:1. Generating the AOT configuration. Run the application with the  flag and specify the output file path via -XX:AOTConfiguration=PATH:java -XX:AOTMode=record -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf -jar app.jar2. Generating the cache with configuration. Change the  mode to  and specify the cache output path using the  flag:java -XX:AOTMode=create -XX:AOTConfiguration=app.aotconf -XX:AOTCache=app.aot -jar app.jar3. Running the application using the cache. Use only the  flag:java -XX:AOTCache=app.aot -jar app.jarAccording to JEP, the loading time for a simple program using the  decreased from 0.031 seconds to 0.018 seconds (a 42% difference). The loading time for a Spring-based project (Spring PetClinic) dropped from 4.486 seconds to 2.604 seconds.I also looked at the simple Quarkus application from the recently published book  (GitHub). The loading time decreased from 3.480 to 2.328 seconds (a 39.67% decrease).JEP 491: Synchronize Virtual Threads without PinningThis JEP resolves the issue of platform thread blocking when using virtual threads in  blocks. To understand the impact of this change, let's first take a look at Project Loom and, more specifically, virtual threads.When virtual threads were introduced in JEP 444, two scenarios were specified in which they wouldn't release the platform thread they were using when blocked:Blocking occurs in a  block;Blocking occurs in native methods—whether they're JNI or Foreign Functions.Now, the first case is invalid. Developers are now free to choose between using the  keyword and the java.util.concurrent.locks package, allowing them to focus solely on the specific requirements of their task.JEP 490: ZGC: Remove the Non-Generational ModeZ Garbage Collector (ZGC) used to support two modes:  and . Since Generational ZGC is the preferred option in most cases, developers have decided to streamline further ZGC support by disabling one of the modes, Non-Generational. The  flag is now deprecated, and the warning message will be displayed if it's used:JEP 498: Warn upon Use of Memory-Access Methods in sun.misc.UnsafeIf memory-related methods from  are called, the warning will be issued. These changes align with the transition toward modern alternatives such as the  and the Foreign Function & Memory API. Additionally, they pass Java closer to removing memory-related methods from , which have already been marked as . This update also encourages library developers to migrate to the new APIs.JEP 472: Prepare to Restrict the Use of JNIUsing  (JNI) and Foreign Function & Memory (FFM) now issues a warning:This is the first step in restricting the use of JNI and FFM. In the future, an exception should be thrown for the code. However, this doesn't mean these features will be removed—which would be ironic, since FFM was released in Java 22. This step is needed for the policy of integrity by default. It just means that developers, who enable native access, should explicitly state that they consider unsafe features of the JDK.JEP 493: Linking Run-Time Images without JMODThe ‑‑enable-linkable-runtime flag, introduced for JDK builds, allows  to create images without relying on  files from the JDK. This optimization reduces the final image size by 25%.JMOD files have been around since Project Jigsaw (Java 9) and are used in the optional linking phase when using  to create a space-optimized JRE.Unlike JAR files, JMODs can store not only  files and resources but also native libraries, licenses, and executables, which are then included in the final JRE. However, JAR files may be sufficient for developing standard applications, there is no need to use JMOD. Additionally, JMOD documentation is severely lacking. Although this change doesn't directly impact developers, it's particularly relevant for containers or when creating minimal runtime images. However, this optimization isn't enabled by default—it's up to individual JDK providers to decide whether to implement it.For example, Eclipse Temurin has already started using this flag, and GraalVM has added support for such builds as well.JEP 486: Permanently Disable the Security ManagerPreparations for disabling java.lang.SecurityManager started back in Java 17, when it was marked  due to the rare usage of this class at high maintenance costs. Now let's go to the changes.The  flag (in any form) is no longer supported and causes an error, except for -Djava.security.manager=disallow:Calling System::setSecurityManager throws an UnsupportedOperationException exception.System properties related to  are now ignored, and the conf/security/java.policy file has been removed.Other changes are documentation-related, for example, references to  and  have been removed.It should be noted that the classes and methods aren't removed but degraded to "empty"—they either return , , pass through the caller's request, or throw a  or UnsupportedOperationException.JEP 479: Remove the Windows 32-bit x86 PortSupport for Windows 32-bit x86 is finally being discontinued. This facilitates the build and test infrastructure, freeing up resources that are no longer needed to maintain the platform.One of the reasons for removing this port is the lack of support for , which fall back to classic . Additionally, support for the latest 32-bit version of Windows 10 will end in October 2025.JEP 501: Deprecate the 32-bit x86 Port for RemovalThe fate of the other 32-bit platforms is clear: they'll be removed, but not in this release.So, Linux remains the last 32-bit supported platform. Building the 32-bit version now requires adding the ‑‑enable-deprecated-ports=yes flag:bash ./configure –enable-deprecated-ports=yesHowever, the complete removal of this port is expected as early as Java 25.JEP 496: Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation MechanismThis and the following JEP focus on post-quantum cryptography.Post-quantum cryptography refers to the creation of cryptographic algorithms that will be effective even after the advent of quantum computers. According to the FIPS 203 standard, the  implementation for , ,  APIs, namely , , and  has been introduced. Now we can generate the key pairs as follows:KeyPairGenerator generator = KeyPairGenerator.getInstance("ML-KEM-1024");
KeyPair keyPair = generator.generateKeyPair();JEP 497: Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature AlgorithmAs a follow-up to the previous JEP, according to the FIPS 204 standard, the implementation for , ,  APIs, namely , , and  has been added. Similar to the previous point, let's look at an example of obtaining an appropriate signature:Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("ML-DSA");JEP 475: Late Barrier Expansion for G1A final JEP that doesn't directly impact Java developers involves changes to the Garbage-First (G1) garbage collector, shifting the implementation of its barriers to a later C2 JIT compilation stage. This adjustment aims to simplify barrier logic for future developers while also reducing C2 compilation time.Beyond this list of new features, some changes remain in the Preview or Experimental status.Hopefully, one of the upcoming releases will enable us to see these innovations in action.You can explore the full list of the JEP links here.Java continues to evolve at a brisk pace, and the introduction of the  reduces the number of dependencies, accelerating updates across the platform even further. That wraps up the Java 24 release for now—so once again, we turn our attention to the long-awaited Project Valhalla.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deaf in Cloud Native Meet Up</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BucO0shTeYM</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/BucO0shTeYM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:55:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

It’s not nearly enough just to know how to code well and implement tasks as you are asked to. You better know well your company’s business side, its important money-making metrics, learn how to cut corners to achieve results faster, find crucial edge cases the product team is not aware of, communicate expectations and your ideas clearly and test the outcomes diligently. Basically, you need to wear many hats and be a bit of everything for your team and company. That usually comes with some heavy experience, try and error ways and constant learning. But you can always grow professionally and become more productive in the shorter period of time, hopefully even earning a promotion while doing it.\
In this article I’m going to share 7 productivity tips I learned the hard way over the years as a senior iOS engineer. Let’s see how exactly you can be a better engineer starting today:1. Keep your internal backlogYes, Jira and other tracking systems are great, but they are designed for your team first, not just for you personally. Everyone uses it to check your progress on sprint tasks, but it’s not granular and not tailored to your goals.\
You don’t need another sophisticated tracking system here. It can be just a notes app on your device or a simple task manager, to-do list or any other way of structuring your tasks. Here is a step by step example of how it can work:Take the sprint tasks from your favorite Jira, look at them and prioritize. What should be your primary task? Hint: usually it’s something business related, maybe a new feature your team expects to be done by the end of the sprint. What are the tasks that can be safely postponed for later and completed if you have some time left? It’s always a good idea to clarify and share your understanding with a manager or a product person. It can be done during sprint planning if you have them.Break down your tasks by days, allocate more time and efforts for your main ones and leave less space for those you deem not so important.Add team meetings and other activities to your list. For example, I find it a good practice to have a dedicated time slot for code reviews every day. This way you don’t need to rush your comments, and there are more chances to contribute better. I published a separate piece on getting the most out of your PR reviews here.Add some other todos to your list that are not included in your sprint. For example, “ask Tom about a change we did last week to see if there is something I need to do next time“Corporate responsibilities should be in the list, as well. Example: “update my goals”, “respond to a company survey request”, etc.Finally, keep track of all these things at the beginning of the day.\
This internal todo helps you to not forget about small things you might miss otherwise.2. Be proactive at team meetingsIt might sound tempting to be present at your team’s meeting, but at the same time try to finish that annoying task or follow up with someone in Slack. But, believe me, it is not the best time to lose focus. Your team members, especially both engineering manager and product manager expect you to be vocal and present. Share your ideas and opinions, ask questions on why and when, take initiative.\
It is a hard work, and I know, there are days you want to sit through quietly with low energy levels. But these efforts usually pay off in the long term.Communication is crucial for software engineers. Try to find a balance in what exactly you’re saying to other people and how.\
For example, during a cross-functional team standup where you have a product manager, a designer, a QA engineer — meaning, people with different backgrounds and responsibilities, — it’s better to filter out in your speech the things they won’t understand. Let’s look at the difference:Yesterday I was applying a patch to our delivery endpoint, when the Cosmos database got corrupted entities inside. I had to roll it back and change the way we insert the hash values in its tables, adding better sorting algorithms.Yesterday I was having a hard time while working on a delivery task. There was a problem during a rollout which I immediately fixed. It was a beta environment, so we’re completely fine. In fact, I improved the way we work with it which we will see in our metrics next week.\
Notice how the second version leaves the tech terms out and focuses on the results that are perfectly clear to everyone? To practice this simpler type of communication try to ask yourself these questions:What do they really want to know?What I am really trying to say?\
It is a virtue to explain a complicated tech stuff in simpler terms. But the better you do it, the better is understanding of it by other people. In the end you’re gonna have less miscommunication problems, less uncertainties and less concerns.\
At last, you can always dig deeper into the tech things if it’s needed or asked. It is the perfect place to do it on the tech syncs with other engineers.4. Build a bridge with your managerThis one does not depend entirely on you, of course, but in general, a good manager is someone who advocates you and your stakes in the eyes of the business. They are the ones who discuss promotions for teammates with upper management and make judgements on whether you are ready to take a bigger role and responsibilities. Hence, it’s in your interests to be in good relationships with your manager.\
How exactly can you plan on doing that? Well, try to put yourself into your manager’s shoes. What are their goals and what does the upper management expect from them? Plan a set of goals for you to achieve in the upcoming performance cycle and commit to them. Present them to the manager, discuss together and see them through. For example, take on a good refactoring project that will improve the product performance. By the way, a good sign of experienced engineer is to be able to delegate some tasks to others, be able to control the process and get the work done.5. Focused work over constant multitaskingLet’s talk about the actual coding routine. Let’s say, you have a task pending to be done from our first tip. How do you approach it? Everywhere around you there are “noise“ factors: meetings, constant Slack messages, etc. I find it to be more effective to shield yourself from external non-important things and let yourself to be in the context of your task preferably without unnecessary interruptions. Get rid of these non-mandatory meetings if possible and do not rush into answering on every Slack message right away. Of course, it doesn’t mean you should ignore DMs all the time, but it’s better to avoid disruptions of your “thinking cycle“. What do I mean by that?\
Here’s an example of how it can be done:You have an important bug to solve. There is a couple of theories you want to try.You’re working on the first one. You applied a fix and ready to test if it works.Then you receive a Slack message. By skimming through a notification (literally a second of your time) you know that it can wait.You finish testing the theory. It doesn’t pan out, so next you’re gonna try the second one.Then you take a break and answer on that message.After coming back to the bug you’re ready to work on the next theory.In my experience it’s much harder to come back to something that you left partially unfinished, just left in the middle of the change. The more time in between the breaks, the harder is to get back that context later, “load it into your RAM“ if you will.\
This approach doesn’t mean that it’s ok to ghost your colleagues. No, but in many cases no one expects you to write back instantly. There’s definitely some grace courtesy period, so try to not overreach it. Sometimes, if they ask me to check something, and it takes time whereas my task is more important at that moment, I would let them know that I will check that and come back in an hour or so:Hey, sure, I’m gonna check this and come back to you in an hour. Hope it’s ok with you. It’s just that I have this high-priority task I’ve been dealing with the whole day, and I need to finish it first.\
This way you’re giving an actual ETA to your colleague and don’t leave them hanging while being polite and friendly in your communication.I’ve known very talented engineers with diverse technical backgrounds who were of tremendous help to me. It was a delight to learn from these knowledgeable people. But have they done great in their careers moving up the ladder? Maybe earning a promotion, more responsibilities and a bigger paycheck? Surprisingly, not all of them. One of the reasons it happened this way is because almost no one knew about their work except for the people in their small dev teams.\
Honestly, if you work at a decent company with no micromanaging, no one is watching your pull requests under a microscope 24/7. And that small change that may be saved a company a significant amount of money can easily go unnoticed if not told properly by you to the stakeholders involved. Quite often these people are managers, product owners or heads of departments… Meaning that they are not the tech people in the slightest. So, I advise you to not just show your golden PR, but present it in a way everyone in the company outside of your “tech bubble“ would understand the meaning of it and more importantly, the company value. Presentation, nice graphs, real numbers — all of that. Which leads us back to the 3rd point about soft skills and communication.\
There is a different side to this point that I hear sometimes in complains from fellow engineers. Like that person in your company who is good at self-marketing themselves and makes everything a much bigger thing than it actually was. They might have been praised more by leadership teams just because of their showcase skills. And just because of that it can be looked down upon. But hey, it will be beneficial to pick up a marketing trick or two from them, as well. Yes, “selling” your work is also important.\
If your presentation skills are lacking, think about the ways you could improve it. I would make it as one of personal goals with a clear set of action points. See whether your manager can be of help here. Winking at the 4th tip over there :wink:Last but not least, do not crunch extra hours. Do not overwork. Period.\
It depends on your company culture, but in some places management can be very manipulative in creating the “hurry hurry hurry“ type of atmosphere where NOT staying late in front of your screen is frowned upon. The bottom line is that I would avoid such companies in favor of a better work-life balance. In a nutshell, it means that the company does not value its employees and does not care about them.\
I used to work extra hours before in my early years as an engineer. One time, we were told to release a huge and complicated feature in some fixed amount of time. The deadline was not realistic in a first place. We all knew about it, but for some reason that I already don’t remember of, the team had to get along with it. We crunched through multiple weekends, working at nights. Can you guess what was the result? We couldn’t make it, naturally. In the end, no one actually did anything about it, but I needed a month of no-work weekends after it to get recovered. As our team leader nicely said to me: “This company would take as much of your time as you allow it to“.\
After that incident and many similar ones before, I put my own personal boundaries of where and when the work that I’m being paid for starts and stops. Remember, if you work 5/7 officially, you have a number of hours you are paid for. Even if you work as a freelancer, it’s basically the same thing. There is always a “money per hour” relation. If you do extra hours without extra pay, in most cases you do a disservice to yourself. Trust me, all this can easily lead to a burnout at some point that will be hard to come out of.\
In some rare occasions, it can be beneficial to do extra time, but only if there is a real profit out of it on the horizon. Extra pay, promotion, extra vacation days or some other form of retribution that is actually worth to do it for. But take it as a rule of thumb: make the most out of your working hours and work hard, but at the end of the day, when your clock is up, leave it to the next day. Value your time.I hope that these tips were somewhat of help for you. Maybe some of them you already know about, but others did get you thinking on making improvements with. And that was the reason for writing down these thoughts — to share my experience and see if it can be useful to others. Till the next time, keep growing and be better versions of yourselves!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How likely is Russia&apos;s agreement to the US ceasefire proposal? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvSeEmLUqaQ</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/SvSeEmLUqaQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:29:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[One week after the US paused military assistance to Ukraine, including intelligence sharing, Washington says it has changed its mind.

You’re Doing It Wrong (Unless You Use Standalone Components)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/building-enterprise-angular-apps-youre-doing-it-wrong-unless-you-use-standalone-components?source=rss</link><author>Tom Smykowski</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:25:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Building scalable, enterprise Angular apps comes with some challenges, one of which is to organize project in a way, that something maintained by two-three developers will be good to be developed by several teams like this.\
So the organisation of the project is really important. Especially because an enterprise app can consist of anything between 100 and 500 components and same amount of services.\
By the way, my name is Tom Smykowski, I’m an expert in building scalable, enterprise applications and in this series I’ll be teaching you how to do it!\
Before standalone components were introduced, you had to put every component, directive and pipe into a module. Here’s an example of a module:@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent, HeaderComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  providers: [SomeService],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
\
There were several problems with this approach. First of all, modules aren’t always necessary. Other libraries like React doesn’t require this construct. For a reason, it increases complexity, increases risk of circular dependencies, makes the codebase harder to understand (you have to figure out what module exports your component, especially difficult when working with 3rd party libraries), lazy loading was a bit complex, and well… there was really a nice pattern to use them.\
If you put too much in a module, it gets bloated and your app suffers on performance, because Angular is unable to tree-shake them properly. If you create a module for every component… what is the best option… what’s the point of modules at all?\
These issues led to creation of standalone elements in Angular. Now you import a component, service, or a pipe directly where you use it, from where it’s defined:import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { MeasurementCardComponent } from './measurement-card.component';
import { UnitConverterPipe } from './unit-converter.pipe';
import { StatusDirective } from './status.directive';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-factory-dashboard',
  imports: [
    CommonModule,
    MeasurementCardComponent,
    UnitConverterPipe,
    StatusDirective,
  ],
  // Add other metadata properties here if needed
})
export class FactoryDashboardComponent {
  // Component logic goes here
}
\
As you can see, it’s easier to figure out and find dependencies of the component using standalone entities.When you are not there yet with your codebase to use standalone entities, you have to know that in Angular 19 components are standalone by default. You don’t have to add standalone: true to the decorator:@Component({
  selector: 'app-factory-dashboard',
  standalone: true,
  // Add other metadata properties here
})
\
You can also use the schematic to automatically switch to standalone:ng generate @angular/core:standalone
\
It will also change other elements like bootstrapping and routing. So a lot of things will be taken care of automatically.\
In my experience the schematics works quite good. If you use some special things in your application, you may need to do some manual adjustments. But as long as you sticked to Angular standards, it should go smoothly.\
To summarize by updating and switching to standalone components, your app complexity will drop, maintainability increase, build size will drop and initial load time drop. All of these contribute strongly to building scalable Angular app.\
In my experience of working on Angular apps serving millions of users, standalone components are mature, and serving purpose they were designed for. So, I encourage you to switch to standalone entities.\
I’ve prepared a free checklist how to make your Angular app scalable and ready for enterprise demand. If you’re interested, you can get this .\

Yet every now and then, something revolutionary appears that totally just rewrites the rules. Right now, that innovation is Manus AI, a groundbreaking creation by a Chinese startup called Monica.\
Since its official launch on March 6, 2025, Manus has quickly caught global attention, prompting intense conversations and excitement about what's next in AI technology. But why exactly is everyone talking about Manus?Introducing Manus: An AI That Actually Gets Things DoneDuring Manus’s recent launch event, Peak, the co-founder and Chief Scientist of Manus, said that they have been quietly building what they believe is the next big evolution in AI. He further said,"Today, we're launching an early preview of Manus, the first general AI agent. This isn't just another chat-based workflow but a truly autonomous agent that bridges the gap between conception and execution."\
Unlike traditional chatbots, Manus doesn’t merely answer questions—it independently completes entire tasks without continuous oversight.\
Picture this: You’re planning a two-week trip to Japan and simply instruct Manus, "Plan my trip and keep the budget under $2,000." Within moments, Manus independently scours travel websites, compares flights, arranges accommodations, and compiles a detailed itinerary—without any additional guidance from you.\
But the magic doesn't stop at travel planning. Manus can screen job resumes, conduct complex market research, build fully functioning websites, and even analyze financial data in real-time. As Peak confidently showcased during the demonstration:“In this example, we ask Manus to help screen resumes. I've just sent Manus a zip file containing 10 documents. Since each Manus session has its own virtual computer, it works just like a human—first unzipping the file, reading each résumé page-by-page, and compiling important information. It then ranks the candidates and, if you prefer, presents everything neatly in a spreadsheet.”\
Manus is also capable of tackling complex research projects. Peak shared another example:“We asked Manus to filter New York properties based on safety, school quality, and budget constraints. It independently researched safe neighborhoods, investigated middle schools, wrote a Python script to handle budget calculations, and finally delivered a detailed report along with recommended properties.”\
This kind of autonomy, performing intricate tasks, even while users are offline, makes Manus stand out.Why Manus AI is Creating So Much BuzzWith heavyweights like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic dominating AI headlines, Manus manages to stand apart for several reasons:Full Autonomy: Manus doesn’t need constant prompts. As Peak explained, “While other AI stops at generating ideas, Manus delivers results. It's built for long-term projects, continuing its work even after you log off.”  \n Complete Transparency: AI is often criticized as a “black box,” where nobody knows exactly how decisions get made. Manus addresses this head-on. "We built Manus to openly show each step in its thinking process, making decisions clear and trustworthy," Peak noted during the demo.  \n Real-World Results: Manus doesn't just promise—it delivers. In recent benchmarks evaluating real-world scenarios, Manus has already surpassed OpenAI’s famed DeepResearch system. Peak highlighted, “Beyond benchmarks, Manus has proven its capabilities on real-world platforms like Upwork, Fiverr, and Kaggle.”How Did Manus Suddenly Capture Everyone’s Attention?The rapid rise in Manus’s popularity echoes recent AI sensations like DeepSeek’s R1. But Manus might be even bigger. When Manus's demo video surfaced on social media platform X, it quickly went viral—within hours, it had racked up over 200,000 views. Tech enthusiasts worldwide scrambled for invitation codes. The video itself was astonishing: Manus seamlessly jumped between platforms like X and Telegram, managing over fifty screens simultaneously, effortlessly multitasking at a level previously unseen.\
While the AI's capabilities are clear, its origins are still somewhat mysterious. The entrepreneur behind Manus is known only as Peak, a Chinese tech innovator famed previously for creating mammoth mobile browsers. Beyond this, not much is publicly known, adding to the intrigue and speculation around this technology.A Glimpse into the FutureManus isn't widely available yet—it’s still in an exclusive preview phase—but even now, its impact is undeniable. Peak summed up its broader significance perfectly at the launch event:“The name Manus comes from the motto ‘Mens et Manus’—Mind and Hand. It embodies our belief that knowledge must be applied to make a meaningful impact on the world. Manus aims to extend your capabilities, amplify your impact, and become the hand that brings your mind’s vision into reality.”\
As Manus continues to evolve, it prompts some fascinating questions:Will fully autonomous AIs soon manage entire areas of our lives?How might tools like Manus reshape our approach to work, creativity, or even daily decisions?Peak offered an inspiring final note:“The future isn't just about what AI can do for us—it's about how we'll collaborate, coexist, and build together.”\
One thing is clear: Manus AI isn’t merely another passing tech trend. It’s a pivotal moment that could redefine what we believe is possible with artificial intelligence.\
In tech, it’s exactly these kinds of moments—filled with uncertainty, potential, and endless possibilities—that keep us dreaming, exploring, and innovating. And Manus just gave us a thrilling reason to look forward.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>After breaking off their agreement with France, Australians worry they&apos;ll never receive American submarines</title><link>https://www.marianne.net/monde/geopolitique/apres-avoir-rompu-l-accord-avec-la-france-les-australiens-s-inquietent-de-ne-jamais-recevoir-les-sous-marins-americains</link><author>/u/EstablishmentNice377</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 08:15:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
    Le projet de sous-marins australiens va-t-il faire pschitt ? En tout cas, ce n'est pas demain qu'il fera plouf. Un article paru le 6 mars 2025 dans le  s'inquiète d'une possibilité : l'Australie, après avoir voulu faire des économies en n'achetant pas les sous-marins français, risque de se retrouver sans flotte, en raison de la défaillance de l'éternel allié américain.

    Récapitulons. Le 15 septembre 2021, Australie, États-Unis et Royaume-Uni dévoilent une petite bombe dans le milieu de la défense : AUKUS. Issu de 18 mois de pourparlers secrets, cet accord prévoit une large coopération militaire entre l'Oncle Sam, le partenaire particulier britannique et son allié du Commonwealth.

    Au cœur des négociations, l'acquisition par la marine australienne de cinq sous-marins de style britannique, et trois sous-marins américains. Mécaniquement, cet accord met donc fin à un engagement d'achat de 12 sous-marins français : donc à un contrat de 56 milliards d'euros. Petit scandale diplomatique. La France rappelle même ses ambassadeurs en Australie et aux États-Unis, en réaction à ce qui ressemble à un coup de poignard industriel dans le dos.
Pas de garantie de livraison
    Sauf que quelques années plus tard, patatras. Les sous-marins nucléaires – par leur motorisation, pas par leurs missiles – semblent s'éloigner… En tout cas, les Australiens se rendent compte qu'ils sont peut-être les dindons de l'accord. Dans son article pour le , le journaliste australien Ben Doherty s'inquiète sur la souveraineté des futurs sous-marins « australiens » : « Ces sous-marins nucléaires, stationnés en Australie, pourraient arborer des drapeaux américains, transporter des armes américaines, être commandés et armés par des officiers et des marins américains. L'Australie, allié indéfectible, est réduite à une garnison opérationnelle avancée – selon les termes du président de la commission des Affaires étrangères du Congrès américain, rien de plus qu'une "base centrale d'opérations à partir de laquelle il est possible de projeter la puissance". »
    À vrai dire, la possibilité même que ces submersibles existent un jour pose question. « Tant à Washington qu'à Canberra, la toute première étape suscite une inquiétude croissante : la capacité de l'Amérique à construire les bateaux qu'elle a promis à l'Australie », abonde le reporter. L'allié américain est en effet de moins en moins fiable, et se concentre sur ses propres capacités, plutôt que sur la coopération.

    Le petit vent de panique atteint même l'ancien Premier ministre Malcolm Turnbull : « Il se peut que, malheureusement, nous finissions par ne plus avoir de sous-marins. Nous devrons alors investir dans d'autres moyens de défense. Mais le message principal est que nous allons devoir envisager de défendre l'Australie par nos propres moyens. » D'autant que leur engagement avec les Américains risque de leur coûter beaucoup plus cher que prévu financièrement, s'ils veulent convaincre Donald Trump de vraiment leur construire les bateaux tant désirés. Dommage…

Success doesn't just drop on your lap. You have to go out and fight for it every day.” \n  \n ― Dana White\
It has been proven time and time again that qualities like grit can make all the difference when it comes to achieving success—no matter how you define it or the kind of success you’re chasing. However, beyond grit, determination, and drive, there are countless distractions that can stand in your way.\
These distractions can crush your dreams and goals in an instant, draining every ounce of ambition and determination from within. They are the very obstacles that cause many of us to abandon our dreams too soon, regardless of how significant our aspirations may be.\
In this post, I will share with you the 5 simple reasons why people give up far too easily.1. Surrounded By People Who’ve Given Up“Surround yourself with people on the same mission as you.”\
Who better to surround yourself with than people who’ve given up on their life goals and dreams… Doing this is the dumbest thing you can do if you expect more out of your life. What chance does an aspiring singer have if he/she is surrounded by people who’ve quit on their own dreams and goals?\
Or worse, these are the types of people they take bullshit advice from? These types of people will tell you things like:There’s no way you’ll be successful.If I didn’t succeed, you won’t either.Nobody in our family/area is successful, so what makes you any different?It’s nice to dream, but it’s not realistic.Just get a basic job, start a family, and settle.Your goals are unrealistic.\
They’ll tell you things like this because that’s their reality. And if they don’t tell you directly, they’ll tell you through their behavior. They’re not giving you advice, they’re giving themselves advice. They’re not talking to you, they’re talking to a mirror.\
So, one way or another, you’ll more than likely give up after a couple of months, or even after a short year—unless you change your circle of friends, associates, and the people you let into your life every day.2. Reading Too Many “30 under 30” Billionaire Lists“Money is only a tool. It will take you wherever you wish, but it will not replace you as the driver.”\
You know the ones I’m talking about. The types of lists Forbes publishes every year or so. There’s nothing wrong with these lists, in fact, they’re inspirational, and there’s something we can learn from those who are on it.\
But when you get caught up in the thought of mimicking what they’ve done, as quickly as they’ve done it, you become delusional. The fact is almost 100% of people will never accumulate billions of pounds before they’re 30 years old. It’s not that it’s impossible, but the probability is low.\
When you’re looking at the world through delusional eyes, you end up disappointed, depressed, failing, and questioning whether you’re good enough or not. Then your self-esteem starts taking a pounding like it’s just been in a fight with Mike Tyson.\
And that’s when the thought of giving up starts creeping in before it becomes your reality. Having high expectations is NOT the same as having delusional expectations. Don’t get the two definitions confused.3. Not Having A Clear Purpose“A lack of clarity could put the breaks on any journey to success.”\
Most of us have no idea why we’re doing what we’re doing. I know I’ve been there. Having no clear sense of purpose, or “why” behind my actions is what caused me to procrastinate, and quit too fast and too soon.\
Just imagine how disastrous that would be if the pilot flying tons of people from one country to another had NO idea what he/she was doing. Well, that’s exactly how disastrous it is to your life, your goals, your aims, and your dreams.\
This is why smart goal setting is essential—it gives you direction and clarity, helping you stay focused on your purpose. Not knowing why, and not having a strong enough “why” will cause YOUR plane to crash, burn, and explode until there’s nothing left of it.\
Then that’ll cause you to quit, give up, or worse, to never ever dare to try again. Write down WHY you’re doing what you’re doing, and WHY it matters. And If it doesn’t matter, then it’s your job to find something that does matter.\
Something that gives you a strong enough reason to persevere and see it through until completion. Something that you wake up thinking about and go to bed thinking about. And something that keeps you focused on what’s important instead of what’s irrelevant.4. Not Willing To Give Up Old Habits For Better Habits“Don’t make a habit of choosing what feels good over what’s actually good for you.”\
Ever since I started my personal development journey 6+ years ago, I’ve given up video games, watching too much TV, the mainstream news, and many other things. If I never gave up those habits, I wouldn’t even be sat writing out this article.\
Instead, I’d be swimming in a pool of bad habits that are poisonous to my goals and my plans. And I would have shot my ambition in the head a long time ago.\
Grant Cardone is a great example of this.\
Until the age of 25, he was taking drugs, hanging around druggies, and negative people. Then he completely turned his life around by changing his drug habits, and the types of people and things he surrounded himself with.\
If you’re not willing to give up old habits for habits that support your goals, then you may as well tear up the sheet of paper you wrote your goals down on. Or burn it. Because you’ll only get in your way, waste time, and quit on yourself too soon and too early.“Without promotion, something terrible happens… Nothing.”\
There was a time when I was terrified of promoting myself. It wasn’t self-promotion itself that scared me; it was the opinions of other people that scared me.\
What will they think of me? How will they respond? What if they criticize me? What if they don’t agree? The WHAT IF disease stood in my way and I wasn’t willing to fight back.\
If you don’t promote yourself, or worse, you promote yourself too little, then there’s no way you’ll have the stomach to keep persevering and pursuing the things you want.\
One way or another you’ll quit on yourself and make excuses as to why things aren’t working out for you, or why things will NEVER work out for you. You’ll excuse yourself from the fact that you never promoted yourself enough, if at all.\
Nobody will give you what you want if you’re too afraid to ask for it. And there’s no achievement without the involvement of other people. Nothing is achieved alone.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub Promises Personal Freedom, Financial Sovereignty for Pacific Islands</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/pasifika-web3-tech-hub-promises-personal-freedom-financial-sovereignty-for-pacific-islands?source=rss</link><author>Edwin Liava&apos;a</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:57:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Today marks a watershed moment for our Pacific Island communities. With immense pride and profound hope, I officially launch the Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub i.e. a groundbreaking initiative designed to unite our cultural heritage with blockchain innovation.\
On this day, I am giving you the key to your personal freedom and financial sovereignty. This isn't merely a technological project, it's a pathway to economic empowerment and cultural preservation for Pacific Islanders everywhere.\
The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub is a DAO-governed, PASIFIKA token-powered marketplace built on Blockchain technology, connecting our island communities to global markets through a decentralized physical infrastructure (DePIN). This platform will enable us to share our data, digital content, traditional knowledge, handicrafts, and local produce with the world on our own terms, preserving our cultural identity while creating unprecedented economic opportunities.Moving Beyond Legacy SystemsIn recent days, many fellow Tongans have approached me asking if I would consider taking on CEO positions in public enterprises if such roles were advertised. Their queries echo similar questions about the Board of Directors positions I addressed recently.\
My response remains consistent i.e. Why would I want to inherit a mess orchestrated by other people? Let them fix their own problems. I have contributed enough already in the utilities sector, fighting uphill battles against outdated structures and resistant bureaucracies.I have moved on. I am already in Web3, and I am now offering this future to all citizens.\
Just as I outlined in my recent piece about the obsolescence of the Public Enterprises Statutory Board of Directors, our progress demands that we leave behind systems that no longer serve their purpose. The traditional corporate structures that have failed to deliver prosperity to our people cannot be the vehicles for our future success.Building Rather Than RepairingInstead of pouring energy into fixing broken systems, I've chosen to build something entirely new i.e. a system designed specifically for our needs, values, and aspirations.\
The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub represents a fundamental shift in thinking. Rather than creating more oversight layers, redundant bureaucracies, or positions of limited influence, we're establishing direct pathways to market, transparent governance, and genuine community ownership.\
Our decentralized approach eliminates the very inefficiencies I've spent years pointing out in traditional governance structures. Where the current systems create barriers between producers and consumers, our platform creates bridges. Where existing frameworks drain resources through unnecessary administrative layers, our model channels resources directly to value creators.Your Invitation to True SovereigntyToday's launch is an invitation. An invitation to artisans to share their crafts with global markets. An invitation to farmers to receive fair compensation for their produce. An invitation to knowledge keepers to preserve and monetize our cultural wisdom on their own terms.But most importantly, it's an invitation to all Pacific Islanders to claim ownership of their digital and economic future.\
The journey continues, but now with a clear destination i.e. a Pacific that leverages technology not just to participate in the global economy, but to lead it in ways that honor our values, strengthen our communities, and preserve our unique cultural heritage.\
To those who continue asking if I'll return to traditional roles within the existing system, my answer is clear i.e. I've chosen to build the future rather than repair the past. I invite you to join me on this journey toward genuine digital sovereignty and economic empowerment.\
The key to your personal freedom and financial sovereignty is now in your hands. The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub is more than a platform, it's our collective declaration that we will chart our own course in the digital economy, on our own terms, with our cultural values intact.\
The Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub starts today, and it begins with us. You can start by reading our Constitution here on our GitHub repository.\
Watch this space for updatesThe Pasifika Web3 Tech Hub is a DAO-governed, PASIFIKA token-powered marketplace built on Blockchain, connecting island communities to global markets through decentralized infrastructure. We unite traditional knowledge with cutting-edge AI to preserve cultural heritage while creating economic opportunities across the Pacific.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Agentic AI Phones – Are smartphones about to change forever? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji89hYtUpcg</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ji89hYtUpcg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:55:50 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[At MWC Barcelona, China’s Honor announced a $10 billion investment in AI over the next five years, with a vision for agentic AI phones – devices that anticipate your needs before you even ask.

I've been a good freelance developer for 20 years. I've used Ruby on Rails exclusively however never writing my own code always for clients.One day I learned Common Lisp. It was supposed to be a short mission I thought I could learn Common Lisp in ten days and hack a quick server management protocol. I ended up writing throw-away Common Lisp code that generated C for a fully-fledged ASN.1 parser and query system for a custom Common Lisp to C SNMP server.Years later I wrote more and more Common Lisp code and ended up writing cl-unix-cybernetics which has the most stars on Github of all my repos there, and cl-streams and cl-cffi, and finally cl-facts which is a triple store that can be used as a Common Lisp graph database. The results were astonishing : very fast, atomic transactions, nestable transactions, compatible with unwind-protect, only 3 macros to learn and you're all set. Cl-facts was presented as a lightning talk at ELS (European Lisp Symposium) in Belgium. Slides for my talk there are available here : https://git.kmx.io/facts-db/cl-facts/_tree/master/doc/facts.pdf.Writing all these Common Lisp packages took a long time and I was loosing all my clients. I did not care, Common Lisp was awesome and a tool for future generations for sure.However I also had a lot of echoes around me of people failing where Theo de Raadt and others had said they were wrong. Virtual machines still suck a lot of CPU and bandwidth for nothing but emulation. Containers in Linux with cgroups are still full of RCE (remote command execution) and priviledge escalation. New ones are discovered each year. The first report I got on those listed 10 or more RCE + PE (remote root on the machine). Remote root can also escape VMs probably also. You do have backups right ? So it kept me centered on OpenBSD and avoided me the hell that most DevOps faced : Terraform, Ansible and such. So I saw people angry with VMs and containers and also people angry with their very programming language. Like Clojure : who can write a strategy game with thousands of units each having their own vision of the world, without having a garbage collector running like hell ? In fact my friend went away and tried to write the game and failed. Garbage collectors suck, and all my Common Lisp projects have very limited applications just because of the garbage collector. And we all know it's a commercial argument to the jVM : it has one of the best GCs around and it did cost a lot to write correctly. I guess it was not written in a one time scratchSo I thought OK I have a killer app but no-one will run it because it's in Common Lisp. The only rational solution for performance and portability reasons, unless another tool is developed for these specific purpose like C, is C. Linux is written in C, OpenBSD is written in C, GTK+ is object-oriented pure C, GNOME is written in C. Most of the Linux desktop apps are actually written in plain old C. So why try harder ? I know C.So I started writing my  utility library, which would become a language () with an interpreter () but could also be compiled () if we did manage to get it through at some point; and data structures emerged from UTF-8 buffers and the other way around pretty fast and all was bounds-checked at memory cost but the results were awesome. Defensive programming all the way : all bugs are reduced to zero right from the start. The system has been maintained clean of wrong bugs all of the time. There are no security implications of running KC3 code. So very fast a small interpreter was born, pumping  (an enum-tagged union of all datatypes of the language) in a REPL (read eval print loop).3 years later I just finished a 5 layered refactor and all the tests pass again and the webserver seems to not be broken again. The language was renamed from C3 to KC3 as the original name was already taken. So what do we have ?I had already ported the graph database () to C89 and though a couple of bugs remained at the time of import pretty much all the database was written during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020. Everything was there : add a triple, remove a triple, the recursive query system, transactions, logging and persistence. Pixel perfect implementation of my original design in Common Lisp but in plain old C89 which I remembered quite well.Besides the graph data base I also wrote parsers and generators to get formal semantics for all algorithmic types I know of and could write in such a short amount of time : Structs, Linked lists, Maps, Hash tables, Time, Complex, Rationals, Tuples, Code blocks, Quotes, Unquotes, Copy on write, Skip lists, Sets, etc. I have macros like I explain in my other article. I'll do a follow up with some examples of macros. I was very much inspired by the awesome work of José Valim and Elixir. See Fly.io's blog if you want to read José Valim !I have a REPL () which parses keyboard or file input and outputs all results of a KC3 evaluation to the console (standard output). It is used for most of the second phase of unit testing KC3.I have a webserver with an MVC framework which is producing the very webpage you're reading : .I have 700 views on a Common Lisp article which is crazy I did not think Common Lisp had so many followers.I have a documentation website all written using  and a vamped Markdown to HTML C implementation.Come on Discord and join the fun.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI Coding Tools Are Bad News for Lazy Programmers</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/ai-coding-tools-are-bad-news-for-lazy-programmers?source=rss</link><author>Maximiliano Contieri</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 07:36:25 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[How AI is Redefining the Role of Programmers in the Tech IndustryTL;DR: AI-generated code outperforms lazy programmers. Software jobs are declining, but centaurs will survive.\
Today, a friend of mine shared his frustration about being asked to fill out a registration form requiring a username and password.\
The system was poorly designed and demanded a secure password without explaining what the issue was.\
This is a clear example of terrible UX and a lazy programmer unaware of writing error messages with empathy.\
I told my friend this is unacceptable in today's world since modern AIs can easily solve such problems.\
I took my phone and said, "L.M.P.T.F.Y." (Let Me Prompt That For You), the modern equivalent to LMGTFY.\
I quickly wrote a prompt:Give me the code for a secure password validation site with helpful error messages when the user enters a weak password.\
The A.I. successfully provided a working page with this code:document.getElementById('passwordForm')
  .addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault(); 
  // Prevent the form from submitting
  const password = document.getElementById('password').value; 
  // Get the password value
  const errorMessages = document.getElementById('errorMessages'); 
  // Get the error messages container
  errorMessages.innerHTML = ''; // Clear previous error messages

  let errors = []; // Array to store error messages

  // Validate minimum length
  if (password.length < 8) {
    errors.push('The password must be at least 8 characters long.');
  }

  // Validate uppercase letters
    if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
      errors.push('The password must contain one uppercase letter.');
    }

    // Validate lowercase letters
    if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) {
      errors.push('The password must contain one lowercase letter.');
    }

    // Validate numbers
    if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
      errors.push('The password must contain one number.');
    }

    // Validate special characters
    if (!/[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]/.test(password)) {
      errors.push('The password must contain one special character.');
    }

    // Display errors or success message
    if (errors.length > 0) {
      errors.forEach(error => {
          const p = document.createElement('p'); 
          // Create a new paragraph element
          p.textContent = error; 
          // Set the error message as text
          errorMessages.appendChild(p);
          // Add the error message to the container
      });
    } else {
        alert('Valid password!'); 
        // Show success message if no errors
    }
});
\
You can also try it yourself:The AI-generated solution with helpful error messages is bad news for lazy programmers.\
Software development jobs are already declining, and this trend is expected to continue:This is something many people have been forecasting.\
I wrote an article five years ago during the last AI Winter predicting this would happen.As the great Niels Bohr once said:Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.Now, it's clear: lazy programmers are doomed!What can we do as software engineers besides writing mediocre code?Soon, there will be a shortage of handy people such as electricians, plumbers, and painters.A.I. won't take your job. A developer mastering AI tools will.\

These are the key take-aways, most of which focus on the redesign of the first version of Starship (V1) to create the V2 that flew unsuccessfully on those flights:

- Hot separation also aggravates the situation in the compartment.
- Not related to the flames from the Super Heavy during the booster turn.
- This is a fundamental miscalculation in the design of the Starship V2 and the engine section. 
- The fuel lines, wiring for the engines and the power unit will be urgently redone.
- The fate of S35 and S36 is still unclear. Either revision or scrap. 
- For the next ships, some processes may be paused in production until a decision on the design is made. 
- The team was rushed with fixes for S34, hence the nervous start. There was no need to rush. 
- The fixes will take much longer than 4-6 weeks.
- Comprehensive ground testing with long-term fire tests is needed. [emphasis mine] 

It must be emphasized that this information comes from leaks from anonymous sources, and could be significantly incorrect. It does however fit the circumstances, and suggests that the next test flight will not occur in April but will be delayed for an unknown period beyond.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EU to impose counter tariffs: How ripple effects of US tariffs shake global markets | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOopJJTRGds</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/lOopJJTRGds?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:58:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[US President Donald Trump is shaking up global trade again with his latest tariffs on steel and aluminum coming into effect.

In this post we examine the inner workings of the Connections allowing us to escalate privileges and read secrets in backend resources for services ranging from Key Vaults, Storage Blobs, Defender ATP, to Enterprise Jira and SalesForce servers.
During a client engagement, I was checking out their Azure Resources looking for common vulnerabilities. They were utilizing a Logic App to post some messages to Slack. Usually, we can find some tokens or other sensitive information in the workflow run history of these apps, as it is common to not mark input (and output) as sensitive. I could not find anything of the sort in this case, so I moved on from the investigation. However, by chance I saw an odd response from a request automatically made from the portal when going into the API Connection resource. It was something like:

Now, this might seem uninteresting at first glance, but there are two key fields in this response that really opened up a whole slew of possibilities.The Inherent Insecurity of API ConnectionsConsider the  and  fields of the above response. It seems that they provide a sort of proxy between the Azure Management API and the actual backend server, most clearly seen by the  path. We can also see that the connection perhaps is authenticated in some way, by the  value in the . Now, naively, I would think that this means that some user, probably whoever set this up, is authenticated to this connection, and we would need his token to call through the connection, or maybe do an  dance ourselves.What I would  expect is that anyone with Reader permissions on the connection is allowed to arbitrarily call any endpoint on the connection:

The response is actually exactly the same as a direct query on the Slack API endpoint conversations.listWhile the Slack case is perhaps not the most security critical, this result begs the question: Does this work for all the other types of APIs exposed through this interface?The answer is yes. If you have created an API Connection to any backend server, this includes other Azure resources, all Readers on that subscription can call all  requests defined on the connection. Specifically, this includes Key Vaults, SQL Databases, Jira-servers, Defender ATP, etc.Azure Management (ARM) API’s Security ModelBefore I show how to exploit this properly, some background on the Azure Management API is required. While we cannot know for sure how the developers at Microsoft designed the system, it seems clear to me that initially, the security model of the management API considered that Readers should be allowed to perform  requests. You would have to be  or higher to perform any changes, i.e. using any of the , , , etc methods.This can be seen by for instance requiring a number of sensitive endpoints for  to be empty  requests, like List Host Keys.At Binary Security we have reported a number of vulnerabilities relating to the leaking of sensitive information through insecure  endpoints. The result of this is that the security model has been somewhat changed in recent times, and it is now not obvious if a Reader is allowed to call a  endpoint. This is, however, still a viable attack method, and reading the documentation is still a goldmine for exploitable bugs.Getting back to the API Connections, it should be clear that the Management’s /extensions/proxy/{action} endpoints will allow all Readers to call the defined  requests. And while this is not seen as a problem in the ARM world, there is of course no guarantee that the connected API adheres to this security model.Creating an API ConnectionAPI Connections are resources in the Azure world, just like Key Vaults, SQL Databases or VMs, but they are not required to be explicitly created. They are automatically created for you when setting up Actions in a Logic App, so even if you have never heard of them before, it is quite possible that there are a lot of them hanging out in your tenant. For instance, creating a connection to your Key Vault is as easy as going to the Logic App Designer view, finding the Key Vaults actions, setting some initial values and authenticating.
This of course requires that the person setting it up, and authenticating to the Key Vault has appropriate access to the Key Vault. After signing in, it is not required to even save the Workflow, the resource is still created, and will need to be explicitly deleted if it is not needed any more.The flows for internal Azure Resources are all similar, where you can choose between different authentication types. For external resources, the setup varies, but in all cases, some authentication information is saved within the API Connection in some way, and this is used when querying the API.This means that the authentication used on the backend API call is always the same, and does not depend on the user or principal calling the ARM API. Crucially, the backend cannot know whether the call comes from the Logic App or from the proxy endpoint, called by any Reader on the resource.The full list of API Connections (Connectors) can be seen here. The proxy endpoints are not explicitly listed, but they can either be deduced from the API of the connected service, or by querying the  endpoint for that specific Connector, which exposes a Swagger definition of the API. Here we query it for the definition of the Jira Connector:

HTTP/2 200 OK

        "put": {
            "description": "Edits an issue. A transition may be applied and issue properties updated as part of the edit. The edits to the issue's fields are defined using update and fields.",
            "summary": "Edit Issue",
            "tags": [

            ],
            "consumes": [
                "application/json"
            ],
            "parameters": [
                {
                    "name": "connectionId",
                    "in": "path",
                    "required": true,
                    "type": "string",
                    "x-ms-visibility": "internal"
                },
                {
                    "name": "issueIdOrKey",
                    "in": "path",
                    "required": true,
                    "type": "string",
                    "x-ms-summary": "Issue ID or Key",
                    "description": "Provide the Issue ID or Key for the issue you wish to edit",
                    "x-ms-url-encoding": "single"
                },
<...>

The  in this case is the full path to the  endpoint, something like /subscription/[SUBSCRIPTION_ID]/resourceGroups/[RESOURCE_GROUP]/providers/Microsoft.Web/connections/[CONNECTION_NAME]/extensions/proxy/.Armed with this knowledge, we can go searching for sensitive endpoints.The Connector for Key Vaults is maybe the one with the highest impact. The Swagger definition includes these sensitive  endpoints for listing secrets/{connectionId}/secrets/{secretName}/value to retrieve the value of the secretThe SQL Connector is quite similar to the Key Vault, you are basically free to read whatever you want:/{connectionId}/databases -  List Databases - List Datasets/{connectionId}/datasets({dataset})/tables({table})/items - Get rows from a tableThere is also a hilarious error message here, when trying to do some path traversing in the dataset name. It did not seem to be exploitable in any way, but I bet you have never seen a stacktrace exposed in an HTTP status message:The Jira Connector also exposes effectively everything on your Jira instance:/{connectionId}/v2/project/search - List projects/{connectionId}/user/permission/search - List users - List issues/{connectionId}/issue/{issueKey} - Read an issueThis connector is also interesting because it, of course, must be connected to your Jira instance somewhere else on the Internet. When setting up the connection, the developer gives the connection the URL of the Jira Instance. Incredibly, this is ignored in all subsequent requests, and instead, a special  header must be included in the request. This should point to your Jira instance, but there is no verification, so an attacker is free to SSRF at will. By setting this to an attacker-controlled server, the attacker will receive the API token used by the connection. This effectively also bypasses the restriction on the requests, and allows the attacker to query any endpoint with any method.Note that this attack is only possible when using the  authentication mechanism. When using , a GUID is used to identify your Jira Instance.All API Connections must be considered insecure as long as Readers can call the backend server. In nearly all cases I have seen, the connection exposes all information on the backend service. In addition to the ones above, this includes:Google Mail, Contacts, CalendarsI think there is significant undiscovered potential in these connections. Without going into detail, I can tell you that API Connections have a significant amount of architecture hidden between the Management Server and the backend API. All calls go from ARM to a  APIM instance containing every tenant’s API Connection, utilizing a Token Store. The initial authentication setup likewise goes through a  Consent server for storing tokens. If this hidden infrastructure is compromised, there will be significant cross-tenant impact as well.Hopefully by now, you have realized the impact of a lacking security model. While these endpoints are undocumented, that only makes them harder to find, not exploit. I am confident that any security researcher who had found them would immediately have noticed the glaring security hole it puts in their tenant. Hopefully, this post will allow others to discover more insecurities in Azure, so that we can be more secure in the future.Jan 6: Report submitted to Microsoft, both a general for API Connections and one specifically for Jira.Jan 7: API Connection case is closed by Microsoft as not valid, I submit it again with more words.Jan 10: Microsoft confirms the API Connection vulnerabilityJan 12-17: Microsoft fixes the API Connection vulnerability by not allowing any requests through  except for .Jan 30: Microsoft replies on the Jira ticket, saying they cannot reproduce it, which should be obvious, since now it is fixed.Feb 12: Jira Ticket is closedFeb 13: Microsoft replies to the API Connection case, saying it has been fixed.Feb 20: The case is closed as a duplicate.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Gemma 3 Technical Report [pdf]</title><link>https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemma/Gemma3Report.pdf</link><author>meetpateltech</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:39:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The TechBeat: Your Writing Has a Fingerprint—And This Cutting Edge AI Model Can Identify It (3/12/2025)</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/3-12-2025-techbeat?source=rss</link><author>Techbeat</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 06:11:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[By @superlinked [ 11 Min read ]

So when I heard about the Salt Typhoon hacks, I wondered, “Is any of this open source telecom software any good?”In a previous life, I worked with companies that used Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, but I’d never really looked into them beyond the surface-level familiarity congruent to “this uses a similar protocol as RedPhone, somewhere” (this was when Signal was still called TextSecure).I don’t know much about PBX systems, SIP, or even audio encoding. Furthermore, some of the best C programmers I’ve ever met worked in telecom. Hell, some of the longest-running hacker communities have their roots in phone phreaking from the 1980s. Not to mention all the legendary engineers that trace their roots to Bell Labs.This is all to say, I thought looking at this sort of software would be a fruitless endeavor. Surely all of the low-hanging fruit would be found already?Thus, I opened FreeSWITCH’s source code on GitHub and almost immediately found a vulnerability.Buffer Overflow in HTTP Request Handler for XMLRPCIn this excerpt of code, the HTTP request handler for the XMLRPC library bundled with FreeSWITCH writes an arbitrary-length URI to a 4096-byte stack variable called z.char z[4096];
char *p,z1[26],z2[20],z3[9],u;
const char * z4;
int16_t i;
uint32_t k;

if (text) {
    sprintf(z, "Index of %s" CRLF, uri);
I think it’s reasonable to assume that attackers are capable of sending a Request URI longer than 4096 characters.Putting these observations together, it’s pretty easy to see this is a no-auth buffer overflow in their XMLRPC library. Turning this into remote code execution is an exercise left to the reader (mostly because I’m not really up-to-date on OS-level exploit mitigation techniques, and how to bypass them).This is kind of “defensive C programming practices 101” level.Soatok Attempts Coordinated Disclosure(n.b., Please stop saying “responsible” disclosure.): I send a follow-up email to ensure they received my report.: Andrey Volk responds:Since the fixes are now public, I’m left to assume that “embargo has broken,” so to speak. That means I’m free to blog about this publicly.However, I notice they haven’t tagged a new release with this security fix for FreeSWITCH users. I reply:Oh, wonderful. Thanks for getting back to me.Do you have an ETA on when the release will be tagged? I don’t want to publish anything until people can easily install an updated version.A few hours later, Andrey responds to my email.Brace yourselves, it’s a stupid one.Thank you for your interest in FreeSWITCH.We do not have plans to make a release of FreeSWITCH Community till summer 2025.To recap: An employee of SignalWire (which develops FreeSWITCH) came right out and said they would let people who aren’t paying for FreeSWITCH Advantage stay vulnerable until their regularly scheduled release (sometime in the Summer).There are about 8,300 hits on Shodan for FreeSWITCH as I write this. I highly doubt they’re all paying for enterprise support, so we’re talking about potentially thousands of telecom stacks around the world that SignalWire has decided to keep vulnerable until the Summer, even after they published the patches on GitHub.While such a decision might be perfectly legal, it really does not inspire trust in the stewards of this software project to give a shit about the harm their careless coding practices inflict upon their users.TelecomSec: A Systemic IssueThe worst part is, when I confided in a friend that works in telecom (after SignalWire published the fixes, of course) about this carnival-quality vulnerability management from the FreeSWITCH developers, their response was:December 2024 is the last time that alarms were once again raised about known SS7 vulnerabilities that have continued to exist in telephone networks for the past 17 years.And, to be honest, that kind of took the wind out of my sails so I didn’t bother looking at Asterisk or any of the other software.I mean, why bother? I already had the answer to the question that prompted me to look in the first place: Telecom security sucks today.The reason things sucks is largely because there’s very little (if any) money to be made in securing these systems today.Things don’t  be this way, of course.Maybe there’s some opportunity for some enterprising young hacker to write a FreeSWITCH competitor in Rust that has sane vulnerability management around it.Maybe in the future, we’ll find the political will to invest in the security of America’s telecommunications infrastructure. Who knows, some of that money might even percolate towards open source software, and they can hire someone who knows how to run valgrind.Or maybe everything will continue to suck, because incentives rule anything, and there currently aren’t any to do better.It took me a long time to write this one up, despite it being a rather simple technical issue, because I’m sure there are eldritch horrors lurking beneath the surface of this relatively simple finding.The vendor’s response was pretty lame, yeah. But is this vendor the lamest in their industry? I’m not so sure about that one. At least they responded within 90 days and fixed the issue on their GitHub.But, hey, if you’re waiting on SignalWire to get around to running … maybe rebuild from source or block public HTTP access to your FreeSWITCH stack at the firewall level?]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI or just hype?

Prime Minister Múte Bourup Egede cast his ballot at the only polling station in the captial Nuuk. The 31 lawmakers voters chose will shape the island's next four years. Independence from Denmark remains a contentious issue, as well as Donald Trump's threats to take over the island. Greenland has just over 57,000 people, but many fear the world's largest island is fast becoming a pawn in a much larger geopolitical game due to its strategic position in the Arctic.

The Responses API will eventually replace the current Assistants API, which OpenAI plans to retire in the first half of 2026. With the new offering, users can develop custom AI agents that scan company files with a file search utility that rapidly checks company databases (with OpenAI promising not to train its models on these files) and navigate websites -- similar to functions available through OpenAI's Operator agent, whose underlying Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model developers can also access to enable automation of tasks like data entry and other operations.
 
However, OpenAI acknowledges that its CUA model is not yet reliable for automating tasks on operating systems and can make unintended mistakes. The company describes the new API as an early iteration that it will continue to improve over time. Developers using the Responses API can access the same models that power ChatGPT Search: GPT-4o search and GPT-4o mini search. These models can browse the web to answer questions and cite sources in their responses. That's notable because OpenAI says the added web search ability dramatically improves the factual accuracy of its AI models. On OpenAI's SimpleQA benchmark, which aims to measure confabulation rate, GPT-4o search scored 90 percent, while GPT-4o mini search achieved 88 percent -- both substantially outperforming the larger GPT-4.5 model without search, which scored 63 percent.
 
Despite these improvements, the technology still has significant limitations. Aside from issues with CUA properly navigating websites, the improved search capability doesn't completely solve the problem of AI confabulations, with GPT-4o search still making factual mistakes 10 percent of the time. Alongside the Responses API, OpenAI released the open source Agents SDK, providing developers free tools to integrate models with internal systems, implement safeguards, and monitor agent activities. This toolkit follows OpenAI's earlier release of Swarm, a framework for orchestrating multiple agents.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>I&apos;m frustrated, but positive about the future - my experience with Linux</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j99ybp/im_frustrated_but_positive_about_the_future_my/</link><author>/u/Helios5584</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:28:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently decided to take a deep dive into Linux and its many distro's. Due to the rapid degrading of the Windows experience; I wanted something clean, free of bloat, and most importantly, able to run my video games without hassle.I spent many minutes researching and deciding which distro to go with and landed on Nobara. It was love a first site. The interface was kinda like Windows, the default package manager was simple, and the system felt quick and snappy. I had previously tried Linux 5-8 years ago, and my experience back then was pretty negative. Some of my devices were not properly working (due to Pulse Audio) and I could not get them to work. Believe me, I really tried to get into it and fix the issues. With Nobara, everything worked right out of the gate and worked well.I was super hyped with this and was loving Linux. Then came the games.I had recently been playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on Windows and that was the first game I tried installing. I grabbed the latest GE version of proton from Proton Plus, enabled the settings in Steam, and went about downloading the game. It launched great and framerates were smooth. However, upon loading into my save, I started getting firefly artifacting (tiny white boxes randomly appearing and disappearing in the game. I scoured forums, downgraded Mesa drivers, change cpupower governor's, and even went as far as flashing my BIO's. Nothing worked. According to forums, this is likely due to my AMD GPU (7900xtx) interacting with Linux (My card is not bad as it worked great in Windows).Fed up with all the troubleshooting, I decided to try other distro's thinking it might have been Nobara causing the issues. I went to Bazzite: same issue. I went to Ubuntu: same issue. I even built my own Arch install: same issue (this step took a while to build and figure out).I came to the conclusion that it must be something with the drivers. At this point, it felt like Windows was calling out to me, asking me to come back to it. The main reason for my computers existence is to play video games and play them well. If it cannot do that in Linux currently, then I feel like I am almost being forced back to Windows. This is post is not throwing shade at the driver developers for Linux or at the amount of work people put into making Linux better, massive kudo's to all of you. However, it just does not feel like an out of the box experience yet where my games just "work".I plan on trying Linux again in the future. I really enjoyed by time with both Nobara and Bazzite, and I wish to use them full time in the future if the drivers (or whatever was causing the issues) allow. I love open source and everything it stands for. Linux developers: I hope you will keep on putting the effort into making Linux a great place to be, I truly look forward to the Linux future.Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: XPipe, a shell connection hub for SSH, Docker, K8s, VMs, and more</title><link>https://xpipe.io/</link><author>crschnick</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:16:28 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A connection hub to keep track and manage of all your remote connections in one placeA terminal launcher that can launch you into a shell session in your favorite terminal instantlyComplete SSH support, including config files, agent integrations, jump servers, tunnels, key files, smartcards, X11 forwarding, and moreIntegrations for various container runtimes like Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, LXD, incus, plus environments like WSL, Cygwin, MSYS2Support for hypervisors like Proxmox, Hyper-V, KVM, VMware workstation, and more]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: VSC – An open source 3D Rendering Engine in C++</title><link>https://github.com/WW92030-STORAGE/VSC</link><author>NormalExisting</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:08:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Been making this rasterizer engine in C++ for the past few months, now also adding ray-tracing functionality to the system.Simply load a model or generate a mesh, add some lights, and render.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Beyond Diffusion: Inductive Moment Matching</title><link>https://lumalabs.ai/news/inductive-moment-matching</link><author>outrun86</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 03:05:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal dataThere is a growing sentiment in the AI community that generative pre-training is reaching a limit. However, we argue that these limits are not due to a lack of data itself, but rather a stagnation in algorithmic innovation. The field remains dominated by just two paradigms since around mid-2020: autoregressive models for discrete signals and diffusion models for continuous signals. This stagnation has created a bottleneck that prevents us from fully unlocking the potential of rich multi-modal data, which in turn limits the progress on multimodal intelligence.At Luma, we aim to overcome this algorithmic ceiling through the lens of efficient inference-time compute scaling. Today we are introducing a new method, Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), a pre-training technique that not only delivers superior sample quality compared to diffusion models but also offers over a tenfold increase in sampling efficiency. In contrast to consistency models (CMs), which are unstable as a pre-training technique and require special hyperparameter designs, IMM employs a single objective with enhanced stability across diverse settings.How Inductive Moment Matching WorksInference can generally be scaled along two dimensions: extending sequence length (in autoregressive models), and augmenting the number of refinement steps (in diffusion models). While adding more refinement steps significantly boosts diffusion models, simply increasing the model capacity does not yield proportional improvements. This is because diffusion models inherently require more granular steps to converge to an optimal solution, regardless of the networks’ representational power. This shows that, from an inference-time perspective, diffusion models are not optimal in utilizing the networks’ capacity.We illustrate these limitations from an inference perspective by examining the DDIM sampler for diffusion models. In each DDIM iteration, the network first generates a prediction using the current input and timestep, then linearly interpolates this prediction toward that of the next timestep. This constrains the expressive capacity of each iteration as it is linear with respect to the next timestep, ultimately capping performance regardless of the training method employed (see figure below).We design our new pre-training algorithm by first aiming to mitigate this inference limitation. Our new method, Inductive Moment Matching (IMM), introduces a subtle yet powerful modification: alongside the current timestep, the network also processes the target timestep to jump towards. This change enhances the flexibility of each inference iteration, paving the way for state-of-the-art performance and efficiency. We realize this improvement by incorporating maximum mean discrepancy — a robust moment matching technique that was developed more than 15 years ago.We test IMM on various hyperparameters and model architectures. On ImageNet 256x256, IMM achieves 1.99 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and surpasses diffusion models (2.27 FID) and Flow Matching (2.15 FID) with 30x fewer sampling steps. It similarly achieves state-of-the-art 2-step FID of 1.98 on the standard CIFAR-10 dataset for a model trained from scratch.IMM scales with training and inference compute as well as model size. We show in the figure below FID vs. training and inference compute, and we find strong correlation between compute used and performance.Unlike consistency models, which have been shown to have unstable training dynamics, IMM is stable to train across various hyperparameters and architectures.Notably, IMM does not rely on denoising score matching or the score-based stochastic differential equations on which the foundations of diffusion models are built. The key driver of our performance gains is not only moment matching itself, but also our shift towards an inference-first perspective. This not only reveals the inherent limitations in current pre-training paradigms but also empowers us to develop innovative algorithms designed to break through the current limits of pre-training.We believe that this is just the beginning of a paradigm shift towards multi-modal foundation models that transcends current boundaries and fully unlock creative intelligence.If you are interested in the mission, join us.Linqi Zhou, Stefano Ermon, Jiaming Song. “Inductive Moment Matching”.Jiaming Song, Linqi Zhou. “Ideas in Inference-time Scaling can Benefit Generative Pre-training Algorithms”.Song et al. “Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models.” ICLR 2021.Song et al. “Consistency Models.” ICML 2023.Lipman et al. “Flow matching for generative modeling.” ICLR 2023.Gretton et al. “A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample Problem.” NeurIPS 2006.Song et al. “Score-Based Generative Modeling through Stochastic Differential Equations.” ICLR 2021.Kim et al. “Consistency Trajectory Models: Learning Probability Flow ODE Trajectory of Diffusion.” ICLR 2024.Vincent. “A Connection Between Score Matching and Denoising Autoencoders.” Neural Computation (Vol. 23).Geng et al. “Consistency Models Made Easy”.

US President Donald Trump has also backed down from doubling tariffs on Canadian metal imports to 50%, just hours after threatening to do so. Trump announced the reversal after the Canadian province of Ontario said it would suspend its price surcharge on electricity sold to the US. It comes as back-and-forth tariff threats have plunged markets in the US. A previously planned 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports is still set to take effect on Wednesday.

As discussed above, the most closely related work proposed testing the index support of SQLServer in the context of XPath and XQuery [41], which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only work that has tackled the test-oracle problem for XML processors, but is limited in scope.\
Testing XPath functionality. Various approaches to benchmarking XPath implementations or test suites for them have been proposed, the most representative being XPathMark and the W3C qt3 test suite. XPathMark [25] is a benchmark for testing XML processors’ XPath standard 1.0 functionality, containing both correctness as well as performance tests. The W3C qt3 test suite developed by the W3C XQuery and XSLT Working Groups [19] contains around 30,000 tests for XPath and XQuery targeting XPath 3.0 and later versions, which cover a broad range of functions and expressions.\
XML-related automated synthetic data generation. Previous works have proposed approaches for automatically generating XML-related data, such as XML documents, XPath, and XQuery expressions. Aboulnaga et al. proposed an XML document generator to generate synthetic, but complex, structured XML data by introducing recursion and repetition on tag name assignment and controlling the element frequency distribution [20]. Rychnovský and Holubová proposed an approach to generate XML documents related to given XPath queries from a specific XML schema to improve query efficiency [37], which is useful for developers to create micro-benchmarks for testing performance over certain XPath expressions. XQGen [42] is a tool for generating XPath queries that conform to a given XML schema, allowing users to specify multiple parameters, such as the percentage of empty queries desired and the percentage of queries with predicates. XPath generated by XQGen includes only direct node tests without introducing complex expressions, such as axes or function transformations. Similarly, the XQuery generator designed by Todic and Uzelac [41] includes XQuery FLWOR expressions, but the logic predicate consists only of simple operations, such as value comparisons. Neither of these works tackled the test oracle problem, and, as indicated by the results in Section 4.3, given their different focus, they cannot be effectively combined with a differential testing oracle.\
Targeted test case generation. Many testing tools guide their test case generation process to improve testing efficiency, for random approaches such as random byte mutation used in fuzzing approaches generate a large proportion of invalid queries [47]. DynSQL [27] guides the fuzzing process of DBMSs towards increased code coverage and high statement validity. APOLLO [28] is a system for detecting performance regression bugs in DBMSs. It increases the probability of including components from previously encountered performance issues. Cynthia [39] was proposed to test Object Relational Mappers (ORMs) and generates targeted databases dependent on generated abstract SQL queries, which are likely to return non-empty results. Query Plan Guidance (QPG) [22] guides testing towards exploring more unique query plans.\
 The targeted node in XPress was inspired by the pivot row in Pivoted Query Synthesis (PQS) [36], which was originally proposed to test relational DBMSs. PQS’ and XPress’ commonality is that they select a random element, in PQS, a row in the database, while for XPress, a node in an XML document, based on which they generate a query that is guaranteed to fetch the element. However, both the purpose and use of the targeted node and pivot row differ. In PQS, the pivot row is used both for test-case generation and to construct the test oracle, by evaluating an expression and ensuring that it evaluates to true for the pivot row so that it can be used in a query that is guaranteed to fetch the row. Doing so requires a naive reimplementation of all the DBMSs’ operators that should be tested, which incurs a high implementation effort, as highlighted in follow-up work [? ]. In XPress, the targeted node is used only for test-case generation, to improve testing efficiency and to ensure non-empty intermediate results; to this end, XPress uses the XML processor to determine the result of the expression, rather than requiring the reimplementation of operators. In addition, for predicate rectification, XPress provides operator-specific rules, rather than relying on a generic one, aiming to generate more interesting test cases. The high-level idea of a pivot element also inspired other works; for example, recent work on Android testing introduced the concept of a  [40].(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>An Analysis of BaseX Historical Bug Reports</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/an-analysis-of-basex-historical-bug-reports?source=rss</link><author>XPath</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:39:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[4.4 Analysis of BaseX Historical Bug ReportsUnlike formal verification approaches, automatic testing approaches might miss bugs in the system tested. Due to the lack of ground truth, we cannot generally determine which bugs are overlooked by our approach. However, as a best-effort approach, we studied historical bug reports in order to determine whether XPress could have found them.\
 We analyzed all historical BaseX bug reports in its GitHub bug tracker. We selected BaseX, because the majority of issues are closed (1618 out of 1640). The issue tracker of BaseX is used for confirmed bug reports filtered from reports from the mailing list, and the BaseX maintainers carefully label and document them. For these reasons, it was easy to identify and classify the underlying problem of each bug report.\
. We manually analyzed all historical bug issues until 2023 Apr 17 in BaseX, which were 1597 issues, after excluding the issues we reported. To confine the study of bug reports within the scope of XPath, we selected bug reports triggered by only XPath expressions. To determine whether a bug could be theoretically found by XPress, we mainly checked three aspects of the reports. For XPress to cover the test case, both the XML document and the XPath expression in the test case should not include any unimplemented functions or language features. Second, we could construct the sections and the predicate tree structure of XPress for involved predicates to form the pattern of the bug-inducing XPath expression. Third, XML processors should disagree on the result set. Note that this is a best-effort approach, because we might both incorrectly conclude that XPress might find a bug (e.g., it might be unlikely that the test case would be generated in practice) or incorrectly conclude that a bug cannot be found even when a different test-case within the reach of XPress would trigger the same underlying bug.\
. Out of the total 78 bugs that we collected, we identified 20 bugs that could have been detected by XPress. For the other 58 bugs, we identified 4 kinds of bugs that XPress would have failed to find, namely due to (1) unimplemented functionalities (51 cases), (2) invalid inputs where the expected result would be an error (6 cases), (3) processors producing different results (2 cases), and (4) miscellaneous other issues (6 cases). Bugs belonging to more than one group are included in all involved groups. The differential testing oracle fails to detect the bugs with processors producing different results, while we consider the other categories mostly as implementation limitations in test-case generation. Therefore, out of all 78 bugs, 76 bugs (97%) could be detected through differential testing. This further demonstrates the effectiveness of employing a differential testing oracle for XPath-related testing.\
Unimplemented functionalities. Most uncovered bug reports are due to unimplemented functionalities. Unsupported functions include constructors defined by the XML or XPath language standards, array and map functions, and also constructors of derived datatypes [2], such as xs:NMtokens. Given enough time, it would be straightforward to implement them in XPress. For/while loops, variable declaration, if-else conditional expressions, and self-defined functions are also unimplemented. These could be supported based on approaches that have been proposed in the context of compiler testing [32, 43]. Neither the XML documents nor XPath expressions that XPress constructs involve namespaces, which allow distinguishing items with the same tag name. They could be integrated into the XPress test-case generator. By implementing all these features, an additional 38 bugs (48%) could have been found.\
 Bug reports grouped into expected is error refers to invalid test cases, which are successfully executed instead of throwing an error. XPress constructs both syntactically and semantically valid expressions and therefore could not detect bugs within this category. However, the differential testing oracle could detect these bugs by comparing the errors of the different XML processors.\
 The different result category contains queries for which different processors intentionally produce different results, which shows the limitation of the differential testing oracle. One example is the function id, which selects nodes with xml:id attributes. BaseX takes attributes named as id as xml:id attributes, while Saxon and eXist-DB require an explicit declaration.(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Index Support in BaseX, eXist-DB, Saxon, and libxml2: Explained</title><link>https://hackernoon.com/index-support-in-basex-exist-db-saxon-and-libxml2-explained?source=rss</link><author>XPath</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:34:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://hackernoon.com/">Tech - HackerNoon</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[We are aware of only one automated testing approach that has been proposed to test XML processors [41]. It tackled the test oracle problem by using differential testing by comparing the results of Microsoft’s SQLServer with and without using indexes. Their approach was specifically designed to test SQLServer’s index support and is not publicly available. Due to the narrow testing scope, and since the tool is not publicly available, we could not conduct experiments to directly compare the approaches. However, we further extended our tool to support differential testing with index configurations. Both approaches are complementary, as XPress could not only use differential testing among various XML processors, but also create or omit indexes to find additional bugs.\
Index support in BaseX, eXist-DB, Saxon, and libxml2. Database indexes are data structures built to speed up data retrieval [31] and are DBMS-specific. Not all XML processors are DBMSs—as in-memory processors, Saxon and libxml2 lack support for indexes. BaseX and eXist-DB both enable structural indexes, such as storing all distinct paths of nodes by default. For value indexes to optimize querying on content values, BaseX creates text index and attribute index automatically. Users can further define additional indexes. Additionally, BaseX provides token indexes, which apply to specific functions, such as contains-token. eXist supports range indexes, which could be defined for specific nodes or attributes to speed up related comparison searches on their contents.\
. We tested eXist’s range index and BaseX’s token index using the XPath expression generation approach as described in Section 3.2. Due to the found unfixed bugs in eXist, we conducted differential testing within eXist by checking the results with and\
without range index definition. For BaseX, we defined a token index and compared its results directly with the results of Saxon.\
. Throughout the testing method, we detected one additional bug for BaseX[10] and found no additional bugs in eXist. We reported the found bug shown in Figure 9 to the BaseX developers, who quickly fixed it. The query selects all nodes with tag name M in the document which holds attribute v that contains token "a". BaseX returned node M without token index, as expected, while unexpectedly returning an empty result set when not using an index. Overall, while the results suggest that using or removing indexes might find additional bugs, doing so had low effectiveness. A potential explanation could be that our test-case generation approach does not consider when indexes could be applied, which might result in low testing efficiency.[10] https://github.com/BaseXdb/basex/issues/2222(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Geothermal Could Power Nearly All New Data Centers Through 2030</title><link>https://news.slashdot.org/story/25/03/11/2149222/geothermal-could-power-nearly-all-new-data-centers-through-2030?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 01:25:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An anonymous reader quotes a report from TechCrunch: There's a power crunch looming as AI and cloud providers ramp up data center construction. But a new report suggests that a solution lies beneath their foundations. Advanced geothermal power could supply nearly two-thirds of new data center demand by 2030, according to an analysis by the Rhodium Group. The additions would quadruple the amount of geothermal power capacity in the U.S. -- from 4 gigawatts to about 16 gigawatts -- while costing the same or less than what data center operators pay today. In the western U.S., where geothermal resources are more plentiful, the technology could provide 100% of new data center demand. Phoenix, for example, could add 3.8 gigawatts of data center capacity without building a single new conventional power plant.
 
Geothermal resources have enormous potential to provide consistent power. Historically, geothermal power plants have been limited to places where Earth's heat seeps close to the surface. But advanced geothermal techniques could unlock 90 gigawatts of clean power in the U.S. alone, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. [...] Because geothermal power has very low running costs, its price is competitive with data centers' energy costs today, the Rhodium report said. When data centers are sited similarly to how they are today, a process that typically takes into account proximity to fiber optics and major metro areas, geothermal power costs just over $75 per megawatt hour. But when developers account for geothermal potential in their siting, the costs drop significantly, down to around $50 per megawatt hour.
 
The report assumes that new generating capacity would be "behind the meter," which is what experts call power plants that are hooked up directly to a customer, bypassing the grid. Wait times for new power plants to connect to the grid can stretch on for years. As a result, behind the meter arrangements have become more appealing for data center operators who are scrambling to build new capacity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The United Nations voted in favor of the creation of an International Day of Hope.

We considered the only two—to the best of our knowledge—approaches to generate XPath expressions. Neither of them was specifically designed to be combined with a XPath test oracle. XQgen [42] generates XPath queries for micro benchmarking. Its generated predicates only check for sub-element existence. The XQuery generator designed by Todic and Uzelac [41] generates XPath queries for automatically testing index support in DBMSs. Given that indexes apply only to sargable queries (i.e., simple comparisons), the expressions it generates are simple. Both approaches generate XPath expressions based on an XML schema, while XPress generates XPath expressions based on the actual XML document. Based on this, we expect both of them to have low applicability for our differential-testing approach. Given that neither implementations are publicly available, we re-implemented them based on the description in the papers.\
Self-constructed baselines. We also constructed our own baselines to investigate the efficiency of the separate components of XPress. XPress has two main components, namely (1) the targeted predicate generation by using the targeted node to refer to existing nodes and attributes and (2) the predicate rectification to avoid empty result sets. To evaluate the effect of the components individually, we enabled them individually to test whether they improve XPress’s bug detection efficiency.\
. We considered four configurations for our selfconstructed baselines. Apart from our proposed approach introduced in Section 3.2 as (1) Targeted, we derive configuration (2) Targeted without Rectification, (3) Untargeted with Rectification, and (4) Untargeted without Rectification. In (2) Targeted without Rectification, we disable the rectification process, which would otherwise ensure targeted node selection. Since selecting a targeted node for predicate generation guidance always requires at least one node in the result set, we stop generating new sections after an empty result set is produced. In (3) Untargeted with Rectification, we generate predicates without using targeted node information to supply parameters that reference existent context and trigger corner cases for function nodes, while keeping the rectification to ensure that at least one node from the candidate set is included in the result set. In (4) Untargeted without rectification, we remove both components to generate predicates randomly, while omitting rectification.\
. We set each baseline to run for 24 hours [30]. We repeated each experiment 10 times to account for potential performance deviations, and report the arithmetic mean for all metrics. As our testing target, we selected BaseX 10.4, which is the BaseX version that we first started testing. The reason for selecting BaseX as a representative is that we found most bugs in BaseX and all bugs were fixed, allowing us to determine the number of unique bugs we found in a testing campaign by deduplicating bug-inducing test cases automatically. Specifically, given two bug-inducing test cases, we could determine whether they trigger the same underlying bug by identifying their fix commits; only if their associated fix commit are different, do we consider the bugs unique. This is a best-effort technique, as, for example, one fix commit might address multiple bugs. We disabled the generation of the has-children functions as well as using relative XPath expressions in predicates, as they consistently lead to crashes, triggering known bugs.\
Results of existing generators. Neither XQGen nor the Combined XML/XQuery generator found bugs in our experiment. This is expected, as previously proposed approaches were not designed for\
automated testing. As mentioned above, XQGen generates predicates that only check for element existence. The XQuery generator designed by Todic and Uzelac generates simple predicates that include at most one comparison operator.\
Results of different configurations. As Figure 8 shows, our proposed approach, Targeted outperforms the other configurations. Within 24 hours, it found the most number of unique bugs (namely 12.5). Both configurations with targeted generation clearly outperformed the untargeted approaches, while rectification shows a similar performance in the speed of bug detection. As shown in Table 3, both targeted generation and rectification reduce the testing throughput, as they obtain intermediate results using the XML processor under test. Despite generating only 50% of the number of test cases as compared to (4) Untargeted without Rectification, (1) Targeted detected 20× more bug-inducing test cases and 2× more unique bugs. The results show that selecting a target node to guide the XPath generation process improves testing efficiency significantly. As observed above when discussing the small-scope hypothesis, most of the bugs that we found can be reproduced using a single section, explaining the limited effectiveness of rectification. However, we still believe that rectification is an important component, since without it, bugs requiring multiple sections with non-empty results could hardly be found.\
 We collected code coverage for three processors’ core modules for XPress for 24 hours [30] of execution. The result is shown in Table 4. To put the numbers in relation, we collected coverage also for the projects’ test suites; Saxon has no publicly available test suites and is therefore excluded. For the three XML processors, the line coverage ranged from 15% to 20%, and the\
branch coverage ranged from 10% to 16%. The coverage percentages are low, which is expected. The main reason for low code coverage is that XML processors typically also have other components than XPath processing. Taking BaseX as an example, around 21% of uncovered code was GUI-related, 10% was due to lack of full-text functionality support, and 5% were database commands. In Saxon, as another example, XSLT modules have not been covered. A further 18% uncovered code in BaseX involved unimplemented functions; it would be straightforward to implement many additional ones, such as math functions, but the many functions available would make this a tedious task. In Section 4.4, we detail unsupported XPath features, implementing which might allow us to find more bugs. XPress’s test-case generation process primarily aims at generating semantically valid expressions, which results in low error-checking branch coverage, quantifying which is difficult, as the relevant code is spread throughout the code base.(1) Shuxin Li, Southern University of Science and Technology China and Work done during an internship at the National University of Singapore (shuxin.li.lv@gmail.com);(2) Manuel Rigger, National University of Singapore Singapore (rigger@nus.edu.sg).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>New ARandR alternative for X11 display settings</title><link>https://github.com/bossadapt/Display-Settings-Plus</link><author>/u/bossadapt</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:52:12 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Team Behind Las Vegas Sphere Plans 5,000-Capacity &apos;Mini-Spheres&apos;</title><link>https://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/25/03/11/2143232/team-behind-las-vegas-sphere-plans-5000-capacity-mini-spheres?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:45:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sphere Entertainment Co, the company behind the Las Vegas Sphere, said they are considering opening scaled-down versions of the immersive venue in other cities.

some existing defenses against it, and describes how the new
 API added in Go 1.24 provides
a simple and robust defense against unintentional path traversal.“Path traversal” covers a number of related attacks following a common pattern:
A program attempts to open a file in some known location, but an attacker causes
it to open a file in a different location.If the attacker controls part of the filename, they may be able to use relative
directory components ("..") to escape the intended location:f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "../../../../etc/passwd"))
On Windows systems, some names have special meaning:// f will print to the console.
f, err := os.Create(filepath.Join(trustedLocation, "CONOUT$"))
If the attacker controls part of the local filesystem, they may be able to use
symbolic links to cause a program to access the wrong file:// Attacker links /home/user/.config to /home/otheruser/.config:
err := os.WriteFile("/home/user/.config/foo", config, 0o666)
If the program defends against symlink traversal by first verifying that the intended file
does not contain any symlinks, it may still be vulnerable to
time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) races,
where the attacker creates a symlink after the program’s check:// Validate the path before use.
cleaned, err := filepath.EvalSymlinks(unsafePath)
if err != nil {
  return err
}
if !filepath.IsLocal(cleaned) {
  return errors.New("unsafe path")
}

// Attacker replaces part of the path with a symlink.
// The Open call follows the symlink:
f, err := os.Open(cleaned)
Another variety of TOCTOU race involves moving a directory that forms part of a path
mid-traversal. For example, the attacker provides a path such as “a/b/c/../../etc/passwd”,
and renames “a/b/c” to “a/b” while the open operation is in progress.Before we tackle path traversal attacks in general, let’s start with path sanitization.
When a program’s threat model does not include attackers with access to the local file system,
it can be sufficient to validate untrusted input paths before use.Unfortunately, sanitizing paths can be surprisingly tricky,
especially for portable programs that must handle both Unix and Windows paths.
For example, on Windows  reports ,
because the path “\foo” is relative to the current drive.In Go 1.20, we added the 
function, which reports whether a path is “local”. A “local” path is one which:does not escape the directory in which it is evaluated ("../etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not an absolute path ("/etc/passwd" is not allowed);is not empty ("" is not allowed);on Windows, is not a reserved name (“COM1” is not allowed).In Go 1.23, we added the 
function, which converts a /-separated path into a local operating system path.Programs that accept and operate on potentially attacker-controlled paths should almost
always use  or  to validate or sanitize those paths.Path sanitization is not sufficient when attackers may have access to part of
the local filesystem.Multi-user systems are uncommon these days, but attacker access to the filesystem
can still occur in a variety of ways.
An unarchiving utility that extracts a tar or zip file may be induced
to extract a symbolic link and then extract a file name that traverses that link.
A container runtime may give untrusted code access to a portion of the local filesystem.Programs may defend against unintended symlink traversal by using the
path/filepath.EvalSymlinks
function to resolve links in untrusted names before validation, but as described
above this two-step process is vulnerable to TOCTOU races.Before Go 1.24, the safer option was to use a package such as
github.com/google/safeopen,
that provides path traversal-resistant functions for opening a potentially-untrusted
filename within a specific directory.In Go 1.24, we are introducing new APIs in the  package to safely open
a file in a location in a traversal-resistent fashion.The new  type represents a directory somewhere
in the local filesystem. Open a root with the 
function:root, err := os.OpenRoot("/some/root/directory")
if err != nil {
  return err
}
defer root.Close()
 provides methods to operate on files within the root.
These methods all accept filenames relative to the root,
and disallow any operations that would escape from the root either
using relative path components ("..") or symlinks.f, err := root.Open("path/to/file")
 permits relative path components and symlinks that do not escape the root.
For example,  is permitted. Filenames are resolved using the
semantics of the local platform: On Unix systems, this will follow
any symlink in “a” (so long as that link does not escape the root);
while on Windows systems this will open “b” (even if “a” does not exist). currently provides the following set of operations:func (*Root) Create(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) Lstat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
func (*Root) Mkdir(string, fs.FileMode) error
func (*Root) Open(string) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenFile(string, int, fs.FileMode) (*File, error)
func (*Root) OpenRoot(string) (*Root, error)
func (*Root) Remove(string) error
func (*Root) Stat(string) (fs.FileInfo, error)
In addition to the  type, the new
 function
provides a simple way to open a potentially-untrusted filename within a
specific directory:f, err := os.OpenInRoot("/some/root/directory", untrustedFilename)
The  type provides a simple, safe, portable API for operating with untrusted filenames.Caveats and considerationsOn Unix systems,  is implemented using the  family of system calls.
A  contains a file descriptor referencing its root directory and will track that
directory across renames or deletion. defends against symlink traversal but does not limit traversal
of mount points. For example,  does not prevent traversal of
Linux bind mounts. Our threat model is that  defends against
filesystem constructs that may be created by ordinary users (such
as symlinks), but does not handle ones that require root privileges
to create (such as bind mounts).On Windows,  opens a handle referencing its root directory.
The open handle prevents that directory from being renamed or deleted until the  is closed. prevents access to reserved Windows device names such as  and .On WASI, the  package uses the WASI preview 1 filesystem API,
which are intended to provide traversal-resistent filesystem access.
Not all WASI implementations fully support filesystem sandboxing,
however, and ’s defense against traversal is limited to that provided
by the WASI impementation.When GOOS=js, the  package uses the Node.js file system API.
This API does not include the openat family of functions,
and so  is vulnerable to TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) races in symlink
validation on this platform.When GOOS=js, a  references a directory name rather than a file descriptor,
and does not track directories across renames.Plan 9 does not have symlinks.
On Plan 9, a  references a directory name and performs lexical sanitization of
filenames. operations on filenames containing many directory components can be much more expensive
than the equivalent non- operation. Resolving “..” components can also be expensive.
Programs that want to limit the cost of filesystem operations can use  to
remove “..” components from input filenames, and may want to limit the number of
directory components.You should use  or  if:you are opening a file in a directory; ANDthe operation should not access a file outside that directory.For example, an archive extractor writing files to an output directory should use
, because the filenames are potentially untrusted and it would be incorrect
to write a file outside the output directory.However, a command-line program that writes output to a user-specified location
should not use , because the filename is not untrusted and may
refer to anywhere on the filesystem.As a good rule of thumb, code which calls  to combine a fixed directory
and an externally-provided filename should probably use  instead.// This might open a file not located in baseDirectory.
f, err := os.Open(filepath.Join(baseDirectory, filename))

// This will only open files under baseDirectory.
f, err := os.OpenInRoot(baseDirectory, filename)
The  API is new in Go 1.24.
We expect to make additions and refinements to it in future releases.The current implementation prioritizes correctness and safety over performance.
Future versions will take advantage of platform-specific APIs, such as
Linux’s , to improve performance where possible.There are a number of filesystem operations which  does not support yet, such as
creating symbolic links and renaming files. Where possible, we will add support for these
operations. A list of additional functions in progress is in
go.dev/issue/67002.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Philippine ex-President Duterte&apos;s arrest: A critical step for accountability? | DW News</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGkpX0TxmJE</link><author>DW News</author><category>news&quot;</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/xGkpX0TxmJE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:55:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg">News - DW</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The former Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is heading to the Netherlands to face charges of crimes against humanity.

In fact, after maintaining a high-performing team (47%), burnout (41%) is the second most often challenge, survey respondents cited.Conducted by Kickstand Research on behalf of Jellyfish, a provider of a platform for managing software engineering teams, the survey finds that among organizations that have adopted AI, a full 94% said it positively influenced their team’s productivity, with 81% reporting AI increases the quality of code.A total of 84% also said AI frees up time to focus on high-value activities, the survey finds.However, the survey makes it clear there is a disconnect between the managers (48%) and developers/engineers who participated. More than three-quarters of executives (76%) believe their team has embraced AI, while only 52% of the rank-and-file respondents agreed.Of the non-AI users, 48% said their team had not adopted the technology due to security concerns, followed by just over a third (34%) citing a lack of expertise. Just under a quarter (24%) said budget constraints had prevented them from using AI. Notably, 19% of executives who work for organizations that have not embraced AI view it as a gimmick.Jellyfish CEO Andrew Lau said that while there is a lot of hyperbole being thrown around when it comes to AI, software engineering teams should lean into it. AI agents and copilots are bringing inevitable change to software engineering that will change and impact the role of software engineering, he added.AI Models Will Become More CommonplaceLong term, there’s no doubt AI will enable software engineering teams to be more productive as additional advances are made, said Lau. For example, AI models trained for specific domains such as software engineering will become more commonplace, he noted. Many managers and businesspeople in the short term, however, are overestimating the impact AI can in the short term have on software development, he added.In fact, 43% of the developers and engineers surveyed said feel that leadership at their company is out of the loop regarding the challenges software engineering teams face. Just under a third (31%) said their team lacks sufficient visibility into project status and well over a third (37%) said efficiency, predictability and productivity have all decreased on their team in the past year.Overall, more than two-thirds said their engineering organization received a budget increase last year, with 57% of engineering leaders noting the size of their engineering team has increased over the past 12 months. More than half (56%) of all respondents expect the headcount in their department to increase over the next 12 months.However, more than a third (34%) of developers/engineers do not feel the potential for advancement in their current role, with just under a third (32%) considering a career change. Nevertheless, 80% of all respondents said the work they do is rewarding.Thanks to the rise of AI more software will probably be developed in the next few years than all of the past decade. The challenge now becomes how to manage a volume of code that is about to exponentially increase beyond what was once thought to be ever imaginable.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Australia warns US new 25%Steel and aluminium tariff will harm relationship, less than a month after Trump vowed to reconsider them.</title><link>https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/its-bad-for-our-relationship-australia-slams-donald-trumps-tariff-move/news-story/cd4c18090b040beab5eed528c669ec7f?amp</link><author>/u/ASoundAssessment</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:27:09 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft is Replacing Remote Desktop With Its New Windows App</title><link>https://it.slashdot.org/story/25/03/11/2037221/microsoft-is-replacing-remote-desktop-with-its-new-windows-app?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is ending support of its Remote Desktop app for Windows on May 27th.

From a report: The servers allow researchers to share manuscripts for free before peer review and have become an integral part of publishing biology and medical research. Until now, they had been managed by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL) in New York. The new organization, named openRxiv, will have a board of directors and a scientific and medical advisory board. It is supported by a fresh US$16-million grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), the projects' main financial backer. 

"It's just exciting to see this key piece of infrastructure really get the attention that it deserves as a dedicated initiative," says Katie Corker, executive director of ASAPbio, a scientist-driven non-profit organization, which is based in San Francisco, California. Preprints are "the backbone of the scientific publishing ecosystem, maybe especially at the current moment, when there's a lot of worries about who has control of information." 

The launch of openRxiv "reflects a maturation of the projects," which started as an experiment at CSHL, says Richard Sever, a co-founder of both servers and chief science and strategy officer at openRxiv. It has "become so important that they should have their own organization running them, which is focused on the long-term sustainability of the servers, as opposed to being a side project within a big research institution," says Sever.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Startup CTO&apos;s Handbook</title><link>https://github.com/ZachGoldberg/Startup-CTO-Handbook/blob/main/StartupCTOHandbook.md</link><author>simonebrunozzi</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 22:18:42 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/">HN Front</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>6 Years ago I went all in on Linux, Now I&apos;m just basically an AMD fanboy</title><link>https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1j91f84/6_years_ago_i_went_all_in_on_linux_now_im_just/</link><author>/u/Chaos_Blades</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:56:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Lets go all the way back to my first PC. Intel P4 with an ATI X1300 (AGP Slot) Played so much Half Life 1/2 on this baby. Also Command and Conquer Generals. After this It was all Intel/Nvidia up to the GTX 1080. This is when I switched to linux because finally Proton. Quickly did I realize Nvidia GPUs on Linux were a problem. Especially once I wanted an HTPC with Holo ISO. This is when I went to the 5950X and 6900XT. Fantastic experience, has aged like fine wine. Just being part on the Linux community and looking at the Nvidia situation... Worse performance compared to Windows, tons of game specific bugs, Wayland issues, taking months to get driver issues fix, driver updates seem to break as much as they fix. So other than the HDMI 2.1 situation with AMD it has been smooth sailing. HDMI situation is more problems with HDMI Forum and TV makers not putting DisplayPort on TVs so I don't blame AMD for this at all. New GPUs just came out and I am not even considering or looking at what Nvidia is doing. Now lets talk about what is making me realize I am basically just an AMD fanboy at this point. I also have a TrueNAS server I have been running for over a decade (FreeNAS 9.2). Which other than a short period of time I was using an AMD Opteron CPU has also traditionally been Intel/Nvidia. That leads us to today. I am about to go out and upgrade a perfectly working Nvidia Quadro M2000 with an AMD Radeon Pro W6400 only because Nvidia driver (reoccurring theme) has issues with locking up SPICE remote desktop instance. Now while I was trying to find a fix for this problem I decided to do a little research for a motherboard/CPU upgrade and low and behold The best price to performance and power savings is a used 2nd gen AMD EPYC to replace my dual socket E5-2680 v3s (I need a lot of PCI-E). At this point the only Intel/Nvidia parts I have is a Quadro P4000 for Plex transcoding and an Intel Atom C3758R in my pfSense box. I also have a Framework 16 and guess what, all AMD.So TLDR, Nvidia sucks on Linux by pretty much every metric other than video encoding and decoding. Intel GPUs are not as fast as AMD for gaming and maybe one day Intel Arc Pro (A60?) will replace my Quadro P4000 but that day is not today. Intel CPUs just are not as good as AMD right now as far as I am concerned or maybe I am truly a fanboy at this point.Also if anybody is wondering by current distros of choice are... TrueNAS SCALE Bazzite (KDE, until COSMIC is stable) (Desktop, Laptop, HTPC) BIG Pop!_OS fan, just not a good distro right now. Also I have kind of fallen in love with immutable fedora.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump wants to invite Zelensky back to the White House</title><link>https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-invites-zelensky-back-to-white-house-as-ukraine-agrees-to-ceasefire-deal/</link><author>/u/Wonderful-Excuse4922</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:43:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - Europe</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The immediate 30-day ceasefire takes effect as long as Russia agrees.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>OpenAI pushes AI agent capabilities with new developer API</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/openai-pushes-ai-agent-capabilities-with-new-developer-api/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/agent_test-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:42:17 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The AI industry is doing its best to will "agents"—pieces of AI-driven software that can perform multistep actions on your behalf—into reality.

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, one of Trump’s key allies in the EU, has repeatedly undermined EU unity on sanctions. However, until now, Hungary’s opposition has usually amounted to blackmail, demanding concessions from the EU in exchange for its support. This time, however, Brussels sources say Hungary is not making any demands at all.  The sanctions package at risk includes the freezing of tens of billions of euros in assets belonging to Russian companies, oligarchs and politicians.  If the EU fails to renew the restrictions before the deadline, there is a real danger that these funds could be moved out of Europe and lost forever, eliminating a crucial potential resource for Ukraine’s reconstruction and military procurement.  European diplomats are currently scrambling to prevent the worst-case scenario from materialising. However, the issue is likely to resurface as early as July.  European Pravda has uncovered some behind-the-scenes details and explains what is happening.What sanctions are at stake?In simple terms, the European Union's sanctions regime against Russia consists of two main categories, with a history dating back to 2014.  In March 2014, following Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea, the EU imposed individual sanctions on persons and companies responsible for undermining Ukraine’s territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence. In July 2014, after Russian forces shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17, killing all 293 people on board, including 211 EU citizens, the EU introduced economic (or sectoral) sanctions targeting entire sectors of Russia’s economy and key areas of business.  Both sanction categories have been repeatedly expanded since then. Even after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU maintained the legal framework of its 2014 sanctions, continuing to add new restrictions within the same regulatory framework.  However, a key procedural legacy from the pre-war period remains: EU sanctions are only valid for six months at a time and must be formally renewed by the European Council every six months.  The renewal process usually takes place without any debate via a written procedure.  But in 2025, things did not go as planned.All EU sanctions decisions require unanimity. Consequently, the requirement to renew them every six months enables individual countries such as Hungary to exert leverage by threatening to block a decision in exchange for concessions.  Now the renewal of individual sanctions is at stake. Hungary has once again opposed the extension and has not yet lifted its veto.  The sanctions package in question is vast, targeting over 2,400 individuals and entities involved in crimes against Ukraine and its sovereignty since 2014. This includes top Russian leadership – Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, former and current Defence Ministers Sergei Shoigu and Andrei Belousov, and numerous oligarchs who fund the Kremlin.  Under the current decision, all these sanctions are set to expire on 15 March 2025. If they are not renewed, all restrictions will be legally lifted on 16 March 2025.  The sanctions under threat include EU travel bans and asset freezes for Russian individuals and businesses. The latter is particularly significant, as it prevents the Russian elite from accessing and moving their wealth within Europe.The secrets behind Europe's asset freeze The mechanism for freezing Russian assets became fully operational after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.  The total value of Russian assets immobilised in jurisdictions across the EU, the G7 and Australia is estimated at approximately €260 billion. The majority of these funds – around €210 billion – are frozen within the European Union, with €190 billion held in Belgium’s Euroclear, the world’s largest securities depository.  Discussions of frozen Russian assets often focus solely on Russia’s state funds, primarily those of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).  However, as European Pravda has learned, that is far from the whole story.  Money belonging to Putin and his oligarchs is in the mix."Indeed, more than half of the frozen assets do belong to the Central Bank. But at least a third of the total sum consists of funds belonging to sanctioned Russian individuals and entities," a diplomat from a key EU member state told European Pravda.  Russian sources also estimate that about a third of the frozen assets in the EU do not belong to the Russian Central Bank.  While Euroclear does not disclose exact figures, it was recently forced, under Belgian tax regulations on windfall profits, to acknowledge that a significant portion of its frozen Russian assets does not belong to the CBR.  European diplomats recognise that if individual sanctions are not renewed, these assets could be lost.  According to an EU official who spoke to European Pravda on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, failure to extend the sanctions could effectively unfreeze up to 30% of all frozen Russian assets.  That means at least €60 billion (possibly more) could be at stake.  This poses a serious threat to Ukraine's financial aid programmes.  Since late 2024, a new mechanism has been in place whereby G7 countries provide Ukraine with financial aid through loans backed by windfall tax revenues from frozen Russian assets.  If a third of those assets are unfrozen, the resulting loss in revenues would undermine this funding model. Even more critically, it would dash hopes of transferring the frozen assets themselves to Ukraine – something Kyiv considers a potential source for war reparations and reconstruction funding.  For now, all these plans hang in the balance due to Hungary's obstruction.Brussels has no doubt that Hungary is aligning its position with the United States.  "They want to change everything through the so-called American peace negotiations," a diplomat familiar with EU sanctions talks told European Pravda.  The latest round of discussions took place on 10 March in Brussels, during a meeting of EU member state ambassadors.  "For most EU countries, extending sanctions is about ensuring that Ukraine has a strong position in any negotiations. Hungary sees it differently," the diplomat emphasised, adding that Budapest is not demanding the complete removal of sanctions, but a reduction of the list.Multiple sources say that Hungary initially sought to have eight individuals removed from the sanctions list, although diplomats refuse to disclose their names. There has been speculation that Budapest may be pushing for sanctions on Vladimir Putin, Sergei Lavrov and several other Russian officials to be lifted, potentially as a way of creating a more favourable atmosphere for peace talks from the Kremlin’s perspective. However, European Pravda has been unable to confirm or refute these claims.  One detail about Hungary's position is particularly alarming: its diplomats are no longer presenting clear demands.  "Hungary has stated that for now, it does not have a mandate to make a decision on renewing the sanctions regime against Russia," an EU source familiar with the 10 March discussions told European Pravda.  At the time of publication, Hungarian representatives in Brussels had not responded to a request for comment.  The European Commission believes that Hungary will likely agree to extend sanctions at the last minute.  However, EU diplomats are considerably more sceptical.  Two diplomats representing different regions of the EU have suggested that an agreement with Hungary might not be reached by the deadline, meaning the sanctions could expire on 16 March.  "We are very concerned, because this could create serious problems," one of them told European Pravda.  Even in the worst-case scenario, Brussels would still have a brief window to negotiate a late agreement and prevent the release of frozen assets. The EU’s infamous bureaucratic complexity, with its multiple legal and procedural steps, could delay Russia from regaining access to its funds.  Brussels is already preparing for this scenario.  If Hungary continues its blockade until 15 March, the issue will be raised at the EU Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Monday, 17 March. There, foreign ministers from 26 EU states will seek ways to pressure Hungary into approving the sanctions extension.  Some EU officials see this as the most likely outcome.  "Individual sanctions against Russia will be extended on Monday, 17 March during the Foreign Affairs Council meeting, which oversees sanction regimes," one European diplomat confidently stated.  Even if the EU manages to avoid the consequences of a brief lapse in sanctions, this episode raises serious concerns about the integrity of the EU’s sanctions framework as a whole.  For now, European negotiators are using all available leverage, including behind-the-scenes diplomatic tools, to persuade Hungary to approve the sanctions in time.  The next meeting of EU ambassadors is scheduled for Wednesday, 12 March, followed by another critical session on Friday, 14 March, the eve of the deadline.  European Pravda’s correspondent in Brussels ]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>China says it will grow relations with Canada on basis of mutual respect</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china-says-it-will-grow-relations-with-canada-basis-mutual-cooperation-2025-03-10/</link><author>/u/Yveliad</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:39:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Trump imposes, then reverses, new tariffs on Canada</title><link>https://www.axios.com/2025/03/11/trump-tariffs-canada-steel-aluminum</link><author>/u/xpda</author><category>news</category><category>reddit</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:36:49 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=10">News - Reddit - World News</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>gotmux - Go library for tmux</title><link>https://github.com/GianlucaP106/gotmux</link><author>/u/One_Mess_1093</author><category>dev</category><category>reddit</category><category>go</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:33:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/top/?sort=top&amp;t=day&amp;limit=6">Reddit - Go</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple patches 0-day exploited in “extremely sophisticated attack”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/apple-patches-0-day-exploited-in-extremely-sophisticated-attack/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-16e-notch-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 20:26:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple on Tuesday patched a critical zero-day vulnerability in virtually all iPhones and iPad models it supports and said it may have been exploited in “an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals” using older versions of iOS.The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-24201, resides in Webkit, the browser engine driving Safari and all other browsers developed for iPhones and iPads.

This is stated in the Joint Statement following the meeting of the delegations of Ukraine and the USA in Jeddah, reports  citing the Office of the President.Today in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with the gracious hospitality of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the United States and Ukraine took important steps towards restoring reliable peace in Ukraine. Representatives of both countries highly appreciated the courage of the Ukrainian people defending their state and agreed that now is the time to begin the process of establishing lasting peace It is reported that the Ukrainian delegation once again expressed deep gratitude on behalf of the Ukrainian people to President Trump, the US Congress, and the people of the United States for enabling significant progress towards peace.Ukraine expressed its readiness to accept the US proposal for an immediate implementation of a temporary 30-day ceasefire regime, which may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties, provided that it is accepted and simultaneously implemented by the Russian Federation. The United States will inform Russia that reciprocity from Russia is key to achieving peace.The United States is immediately lifting the pause in intelligence sharing and resuming security assistance to Ukraine The delegations also discussed the importance of humanitarian efforts as part of the peace process, particularly during the aforementioned ceasefire regime, including the exchange of prisoners of war, the release of detained civilians, and the return of forcibly displaced Ukrainian children.Both delegations agreed to determine the composition of their negotiating teams and to immediately begin negotiations to achieve a sustainable peace that will ensure Ukraine's long-term security. The United States committed to discussing these specific proposals with representatives of Russia. The Ukrainian delegation once again emphasized that European partners must be involved in the peace process.Finally, the presidents of both countries agreed to conclude a comprehensive agreement as soon as possible for the development of Ukraine's critical mineral resources to strengthen Ukraine's economy and ensure long-term prosperity and security for Ukraine.A senior Ukrainian official commented to AFP assessed that negotiations with the Americans in Saudi Arabia are going "normally," as reported by French media.On March 11, a high-level meeting of the delegations of Ukraine and the USA began in Jeddah. The parties are discussing the path to peace and bilateral relations between the countries.In response to a CNN question about the progress of the meeting, US participant, White House National Security Advisor Mike Waltz briefly responded: "They are progressing" ("Getting there").A member of the Ukrainian delegation in negotiations with the USA in Jeddah, Head of the President's Office Andriy Yermak commented on the progress of negotiations with the US team, stating that "work is ongoing."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Intel Overclocking Watchdog Driver Posted For The Linux Kernel</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Overclocking-Watchdog</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:10:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[An unexpected patch on the Linux kernel mailing list today by a Siemens engineer is implementing a driver for the Intel Over-Clocking Watchdog...]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Are Dyson Spheres even plausible? ☀️</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrbeXNYfRS8</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wrbeXNYfRS8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 18:01:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Be sure to follow: The Astronomical Society @astrosocietypac

Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Paul Mecurio answer questions on the Higgs Field, dark energy, and the feasibility of Dyson spheres with astrophysicist Hakeem Oluseyi.

We discuss Hakeem’s role as CEO of the Astronomical Society, and his work on NASA’s IMAP satellite, designed to study the boundary of our solar system. He shares his vision for making astronomy more accessible, the difference between nerds and geeks, and why he doesn’t wear gold.

Then, we tackle the growing mystery of the universe’s expansion. Is the Hubble tension a sign of undiscovered physics? Could our cosmological models need tweaking? We explore the role of dark energy, the Higgs field, and the unanswered questions that keep physicists awake at night.

Next, we turn our sights to exoplanets. How do scientists detect distant atmospheres? What can JWST reveal? And when it comes to dark matter—could it be defying our understanding of physics itself? We break down theories, alternative gravity models, and the possibility that new technology may finally uncover what’s been eluding us.

Plus, we tackle gravitational waves and time itself—what would happen if we were hit by one? Is “now” just an illusion? We break down the Andromeda Paradox and also touch on black holes, information loss, and the search for Dyson spheres. Could an advanced civilization really build one, or is it just sci-fi fantasy? All this, plus a look at the biggest roadblock in STEM education, the history of mathematical knowledge, and how we can get more people looking up.

As rents rise, so does homelessness. With no house or apartment, Jordyn, Jonathan and their young daughter Delilah have to find a new place to sleep every night.

The young family has been searching for permanent accommodation in Ireland's capital for ten months. Their everyday life involves appointments with the local authorities and endless hours spent on hold on the telephone. They are unable to afford Dublin’s high rents, and social housing seems beyond their reach. Each day, Jordyn, Jonathan and their daughter try to arrange to stay the night with friends or relatives.

Justin is a social worker. He previously worked with homeless people in a privately run emergency shelter. But when the shelter was sold, he lost his job and his home. Now, he spends his days combing through offers on the overpriced housing market. But the few available homes are usually either unaffordable or unsuitable. Single rooms, and even individual beds, are being rented out at fantastical prices.

Conor is currently completing his doctoral thesis, and lives with his girlfriend in a tiny apartment. The housing shortage has turned him into a political activist: he’s running for a seat on the city council and helping to raise awareness of the problem. He collects signatures for a petition to stop apartments being left empty, and for more affordable housing.

Despite the government’s promises, Ireland remains in the midst of a seemingly never-ending housing crisis. For Jordyn, Jonathan and little Delilah, there’s light at the end of the tunnel. But for many others, the situation remains desperate.

The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be stopped with known measures.  

For many people, like César Serrano, it was as if time had stopped, “it's as if a huge storm has come and wiped out everything. Everything is completely deserted, lifeless, closed.” 

It felt like something out of a disaster movie. First came the fear of this unknown virus, followed by lockdowns. Once the first wave had passed, restrictions in some places were eased. Then came further waves and restrictions, but people got used to the changes in their daily life.  

As the pandemic entered its second year, expressions of solidarity, seen at the start, gave way to frustration and anger. People took to the streets in anti-government protests and conspiracy theories spread. People also began to question the price they had paid for efforts made at protecting themselves and others against this virus. 

What impact did the coronavirus pandemic have on our life?

--

Industrial manufacturers spend a huge amount of energy generating heat to make everyday materials and objects, like cement, steel, and paper. And since most companies use fossil fuels to reach these high temperatures, industrial heat accounts for 20% of our annual global carbon pollution. Thankfully, this is where a century-old technology comes in. Rachel Yang explores how heat batteries work.

As your codebase grows, so does the value of TypeScript itself, but in many cases TypeScript has not been able to scale up to the very largest codebases.
Developers working in large projects can experience long load and check times, and have to choose between reasonable editor startup time or getting a complete view of their source code.
We know developers love when they can rename variables with confidence, find all references to a particular function, easily navigate their codebase, and do all of those things without delay.
New experiences powered by AI benefit from large windows of semantic information that need to be available with tighter latency constraints.
We also want fast command-line builds to validate that your entire codebase is in good shape.To meet those goals, we’ve begun work on a native port of the TypeScript compiler and tools.
The native implementation will drastically improve editor startup, reduce most build times by 10x, and substantially reduce memory usage.
By porting the current codebase, we expect to be able to preview a native implementation of  capable of command-line typechecking by mid-2025, with a feature-complete solution for project builds and a language service by the end of the year.You can , which is offered under the same license as the existing TypeScript codebase.
Check the README for instructions on how to build and run  and the language server, and to see a summary of what’s implemented so far.
We’ll be posting regular updates as new functionality becomes available for testing.Our native implementation is already capable of loading many popular TypeScript projects, including the TypeScript compiler itself.
Here are times to run  on some popular codebases on GitHub of varying sizes:While we’re not yet feature-complete, these numbers are representative of the order of magnitude performance improvement you’ll see checking most codebases.We’re incredibly excited about the opportunities that this massive speed boost creates. Features that once seemed out of reach are now within grasp.
This native port will be able to provide instant, comprehensive error listings across an entire project, support more advanced refactorings, and enable deeper insights that were previously too expensive to compute.
This new foundation goes beyond today’s developer experience and will enable the next generation of AI tools to enhance development, powering new tools that will learn, adapt, and improve the coding experience.Most developer time is spent in editors, and it’s where performance is most important.
We want editors to load large projects quickly, and respond quickly in all situations.
Modern editors like Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code have excellent performance as long as the underlying language services are also fast.
With our native implementation, we’ll be able to provide incredibly fast editor experiences.Again using the Visual Studio Code codebase as a benchmark, the current time to load the entire project in the editor on a fast computer is about 9.6 seconds.
This drops down to about 1.2 seconds with the native language service, an 8x improvement in project load time in editor scenarios.
What this translates to is a faster working experience from the time you open your editor to your first keystroke in any TypeScript codebase.
We expect all projects to see this level of improvement in load time.Overall memory usage also appears to be roughly half of the current implementation, though we haven’t actively investigated optimizing this yet and expect to realize further improvements.
Editor responsiveness for all language service operations (including completion lists, quick info, go to definition, and find all references) will also see significant speed gains.
We’ll also be moving to the Language Server Protocol (LSP), a longstanding infrastructural work item to better align our implementation with other languages.Our most recent TypeScript release was TypeScript 5.8, with TypeScript 5.9 coming soon.
The JS-based codebase will continue development into the 6.x series, and TypeScript 6.0 will introduce some deprecations and breaking changes to align with the upcoming native codebase.When the native codebase has reached sufficient parity with the current TypeScript, we’ll be releasing it as .
This is still in development and we’ll be announcing stability and feature milestones as they occur.For the sake of clarity, we’ll refer to them simply as TypeScript 6 (JS) and TypeScript 7 (native), since this will be the nomenclature for the foreseeable future.
You may also see us refer to “Strada” (the original TypeScript codename) and “Corsa” (the codename for this effort) in internal discussions or code comments.While some projects may be able to switch to TypeScript 7 upon release, others may depend on certain API features, legacy configurations, or other constraints that necessitate using TypeScript 6.
Recognizing TypeScript’s critical role in the JS development ecosystem, we’ll still be maintaining the JS codebase in the 6.x line until TypeScript 7+ reaches sufficient maturity and adoption.Our long-term goal is to keep these versions as closely aligned as possible so that you can upgrade to TypeScript 7 as soon as it meets your requirements, or fall back to TypeScript 6 if necessary.In the coming months we’ll be sharing more about this exciting effort, including deeper looks into performance, a new compiler API, LSP, and more.
We’ve written up some FAQs on the GitHub repo to address some questions we expect you might have.
We also invite you to join us for an AMA at the TypeScript Community Discord at  on March 13th.A 10x performance improvement represents a massive leap in the TypeScript and JavaScript development experience, so we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are for this effort!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Google&apos;s Pixel Watch Knows When Your Heart Stops Beating</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/heart-attack-smartwatch</link><author>Elissa Welle</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjcwNTY3Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3Mjg3MTEyOH0.GzE5L4Fb8ueiISIYEvX3bBMzEfsD14la9xuOopm36Mk/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:30:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The feature set to roll out in the US this month will call 911 if you can’t]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happy 20th birthday, Y Combinator</title><link>https://twitter.com/garrytan/status/1899092996702048709</link><author>btilly</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:14:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Graveyard at the Center of the Earth</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=din1J2mZmc4</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/din1J2mZmc4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 14:00:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[It's Patron Appreciation Month at Eons, and you're invited!

It provides a controlled environment where AI models can attempt complex automation, resource management, and optimisation tasks in a grounded world with meaningful constraints.A critical advantage of Factorio as a benchmark is its unbounded nature. Unlike many evals that are quickly saturated by newer models, Factorio's geometric complexity scaling means it won't be "solved" in the next 6 months (or possibly even years). This allows us to meaningfully compare models by the order-of-magnitude of resources they can produce - creating a benchmark with longevity.The project began 18 months ago after years of playing Factorio, recognising its potential as an AI research testbed. A few months ago, our team (myself, Akbir, and Mart) came together to create a benchmark that tests agent capabilities in spatial reasoning and long-term planning.Two technical innovations drove this project forward: First, we discovered that piping Lua into the Factorio console over TCP enables running (almost) arbitrary code without directly modding the game. Second, we developed a first-class Python API that wraps these Lua programs to provide a clean, type-hinted interface for AI agents to interact with Factorio through familiar programming paradigms.Agents interact with FLE through a REPL pattern:
1. They observe the world (seeing the output of their last action)
2. Generate Python code to perform their next action
3. Receive detailed feedback (including exceptions and stdout)We provide two main evaluation settings:
- Lab-play: 24 structured tasks with fixed resources
- Open-play: An unbounded task of building the largest possible factory on a procedurally generated mapWe found that while LLMs show promising short-horizon skills, they struggle with spatial reasoning in constrained environments. They can discover basic automation strategies (like electric-powered drilling) but fail to achieve more complex automation (like electronic circuit manufacturing). Claude Sonnet 3.5 is currently the best model (by a significant margin).You'll need:
- Factorio (version 1.1.110)
- Docker
- Python 3.10+The README contains detailed installation instructions and examples of how to run evaluations with different LLM agents.We would love to hear your thoughts and see what others can do with this framework!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The DEVASTATING first attack of Desert Storm</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXxiGfVfQzk</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JXxiGfVfQzk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 12:00:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[#desertstorm #history #gulfwar #iraq #iwm]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft’s Muse AI Edits Video Games on the Fly</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-video-games</link><author>Matthew S.

This video is presented by Robinhood. Our sponsor has no editorial influence over how we report our stories, but their support makes videos like these possible.

When you get to a place financially where you can begin to start saving, rather than living paycheck to paycheck, a big question often comes up: ”Should I pay off my debt or invest in the stock market?” There’s no simple answer, but there’s a simple rule of thumb that can help you decide what to do with this money to have the best financial outcome in the long run. 

The first place to look is the interest rate on your debt and see if it’s below 7%, the rate of return you can conservatively expect from investing in an index fund, like the S&P 500. If your debt — like a mortgage or a student loan — falls below 7%, it is usually mathematically more beneficial to invest in the stock market while you pay down the debt by its minimum payments. The logic being: You’ll likely earn more interest by investing than your debt will accrue in that time. 

Higher interest rate debt, like credit card debt, should almost always be eliminated as soon as possible, since you are statistically unlikely to see a rate of return from investing past 7 to 10% annually. And of course, investing always comes with risk. So the most secure bet is always to work toward being debt-free.

These digital documents serve as containers for everything from scientific research to government records, but their rigid formats often trap the data inside, making it difficult for machines to read and analyze."Part of the problem is that PDFs are a creature of a time when print layout was a big influence on publishing software, and PDFs are more of a 'print' product than a digital one," Derek Willis, a lecturer in Data and Computational Journalism at the University of Maryland, wrote in an email to Ars Technica. "The main issue is that many PDFs are simply pictures of information, which means you need Optical Character Recognition software to turn those pictures into data, especially when the original is old or includes handwriting."Computational journalism is a field where traditional reporting techniques merge with data analysis, coding, and algorithmic thinking to uncover stories that might otherwise remain hidden in large datasets, which makes unlocking that data a particular interest for Willis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>UK Greenlights Amazon Kuiper, Starlink Faces New Rival</title><link>https://spectrum.ieee.org/starlink-internet-kuiper-competition</link><author>Margo Anderson</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy81NjYzMTg2Ni9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc3MDc2MjA5Nn0.bmrElVf6-ehF4bT2-fpNTfzZKS4uhqwZHxx_YwvZ1bM/image.jpg?width=600" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 11:00:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://spectrum.ieee.org/">IEEE Spectrum</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Satellite broadband tech squares off, while also trying to avoid collisions]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COBOL Language Frontend Merged For GCC 15 Compiler</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/GCC-15-Merges-COBOL</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Tue, 11 Mar 2025 10:22:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A big albeit late feature landed today for the upcoming GCC 15 compiler...

But instead of facing trial in the US, Lee now lives in Dubai, where he’s pitching new crypto products. 

Lee denies any wrongdoing. But crypto industry experts, alleged victims and online “scam hunters” are raising questions about whether regulators in the United Arab Emirates are doing enough to combat crypto fraud as Dubai seeks to position itself as a hub of finance and technology.

On a scorching July day in Dubai, Sam Lee was inside a climate-controlled wine bar, sipping a glass of chilled red, looking untouchable. Near the beginning of the year, US authorities announced that they’d charged Lee with conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud. They alleged that, as the co-founder of a company called HyperVerse, he’d orchestrated a cryptocurrency scam that bilked investors around the world for almost $2 billion. HyperVerse had promised returns as high as 1% a day via cutting-edge blockchain-based strategies, but according to the US Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, it was just an old-fashioned Ponzi scheme. Lee has denied wrongdoing.

On the other hand, GraphQL, a newer query language developed by Facebook, takes a more flexible and efficient approach, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request.In this article, we’ll break down REST and GraphQL, compare their differences, and help you decide which one is best suited for your use case. emerged in the early 2000s as a set of architectural principles for designing networked applications.REST is not a protocol or standard but rather a set of guiding principles that leverage the existing  to enable communication between clients and servers.At its core, REST is built around . Each resource (such as a user, order, or product) is uniquely identified by a Uniform Resource Locator, and clients interact with these resources using a fixed set of HTTP methods. → Retrieve a resource (e.g.,  to fetch user data). → Create a new resource (e.g.,  to add a new user). → Update an existing resource (e.g.,  to update user details). → Remove a resource (e.g.,  to delete a user).For example, let’s say a client needs information about a specific user with .The client makes a requestThe server responds with a JSON representation of the userREST APIs typically  and use  to communicate the outcome of the request: → Resource successfully created → Client error (e.g., missing required fields) → Requested resource does not exist500 Internal Server Error → Unexpected server issueSimplicity and Intuitive Design: The resource-based model aligns well with most business domains, making REST intuitive for developers.: Each request contains all the information needed to complete it, making REST scalable across distributed systems.: HTTP's caching mechanisms can be leveraged to improve performance.REST APIs can be easily scaled using load balancers and CDNs.: With nearly two decades of widespread use, REST enjoys robust tooling, documentation, and developer familiarity.REST endpoints often return , leading to inefficient network usage. For example, if a mobile app only needs a user’s name and email, but the API response includes additional fields like address, phone number, and metadata, it results in .: If an API doesn’t return related data, the client may need to  to retrieve all required information. For example, to get user details and their posts, a client might have to make: (fetch user) (fetch user’s posts): When APIs evolve, maintaining backward compatibility becomes difficult. REST APIs often require  (, ), adding maintenance overhead.Rigid Response Structure: The server defines how data is returned, and clients must adapt to it—even if they only need a subset of the data.For years,  was the de facto standard for building APIs. However, as applications grew more complex, REST began to show limitations—especially in scenarios where clients needed fine-grained control over the data they fetched.To address these challenges, Facebook introduced GraphQL in 2015, offering a more flexible and efficient approach to data retrieval.Unlike REST, which organizes APIs around fixed endpoints and HTTP methods, GraphQL is a  that allows clients to request exactly the data they need—nothing more, nothing less.A  () replaces multiple REST endpoints, allowing clients to structure their own queries instead of relying on predefined responses.Here, the query asks for a specific user's firstName, email, profileUrl and posts, all within a GraphQL aggregates the data from multiple services and returns precisely the requested data.It solves the problems of  (getting unnecessary data) and  (requiring multiple requests to retrieve related data).Unlike REST, where API responses are  and may vary across versions, GraphQL enforces a strict schema that defines the shape of the data.A simple GraphQL schema for the above example might look like this:type User {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  email: String!
  profile: Profile!
  posts: [Post!]
}

type Profile {
  id: ID!
  url: String!
}

type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  publishedDate: String!
  content: String!
  author: User!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  posts: [Post!]!
}Three Core Functionalities of GraphQLGraphQL provides three core functionalities:Similar to GET requests in REST, GraphQL queries allow clients to request specific fields of data.Clients have full control over what they retrieve, avoiding unnecessary data fetching.Example: Fetching specific user and post details in a single requestquery {
  user(id: 123) {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
      content
    }
  }
}Equivalent to POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE in REST. Used to create, update, or delete resources in the API.Example: Creating a new postmutation {
  createPost(title: "GraphQL vs REST", content: "GraphQL solves many of REST's limitations...", publishedDate: "2025-03-10") {
    id
    title
    content
  }
}The response will contain the newly created post with its .3.  → Real-Time UpdatesUnlike REST, which requires polling or WebSockets for real-time updates, GraphQL subscriptions enable clients to listen for changes and receive updates automatically when data is modified.Ideal for chat applications, live feeds, stock market updates, and notifications.Example: Listening for new postssubscription {
  newPost {
    title
    content
    author {
      name
    }
  }
}Whenever a , all subscribed clients will .How GraphQL Differs from RESTBoth GraphQL and REST rely on HTTP requests and responses, but they differ in how they structure and deliver data.REST centers around resources (each identified by a URL).GraphQL centers around a schema that defines the types of data available.In REST, the  decides which data is included in a response. If a client requests a blog post, the API might also return related , even if they aren’t needed.With GraphQL, the  what to fetch. This makes GraphQL more flexible but also introduces challenges in caching and performance optimization.: Clients can request only the fields they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching.Single Request for Multiple Resources: Related data can be retrieved in one request, solving REST’s  query problem.: GraphQL APIs use a schema to define available data, making them easier to explore and document.Real-time Data with Subscriptions: GraphQL natively supports real-time data updates through subscriptions, enabling clients to receive automatic notifications whenever data changes on the server.API Evolution Without Versioning: New fields can be added without breaking existing queries, avoiding REST-style ,  versioning issues.: Unlike REST, which can be used with basic HTTP clients (cURL, browsers), GraphQL requires a GraphQL server, schema, and resolvers.: REST APIs leverage HTTP caching (e.g., browser caching, CDNs), but GraphQL queries use POST requests, making caching trickier. Since clients can request arbitrary amounts of data, GraphQL APIs must be carefully optimized to prevent performance issues. Unoptimized queries (e.g., deeply nested requests) can lead to costly database scans, increasing the risk of denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.Performance Risks with GraphQLImagine a mobile app introduces a  that unexpectedly triggers a  on a critical database table.With REST, this scenario is less likely because API endpoints are predefined, and developers control how data is exposed.With GraphQL, the client , which could inadvertently request massive amounts of data. If a poorly designed query is executed on a high-traffic service, it could bring down the entire database.To mitigate this, GraphQL APIs require strict query rate limiting, depth restrictions, and cost analysis mechanisms—adding additional complexity to the implementation.There is no  answer.  remains a great choice for simple APIs, while  is powerful for complex applications with varying data needs.Ultimately, it’s not about which is better, but which is better for your specific needs.Your API is simple and doesn’t require flexible queries.You need caching benefits from HTTP. You need a standardized, well-established API  approach.You’re integrating with third-party services.Your team is already familiar with REST and need faster implementation.You need flexible and efficient data fetching.Your API serves multiple clients (mobile, web, IoT) with different data needs.Real-time updates are required (GraphQL subscriptions). You want to avoid API versioning issues.Your application requires deeply nested dataCan You Use Both REST and GraphQL?Absolutely! REST and GraphQL are , and many organizations implement a  to get the best of both worlds:GraphQL for client-facing applications where flexibility, performance, and dynamic querying are essential.REST for admin interfaces, third-party integrations, and internal microservices where statelessness, caching, and simplicity are beneficial.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

However, Trump is quite alone with this opinion in the professional world. History has taught us that trade wars are not "easy" or "good." Nevertheless, experts fear that the conflicts Trump has instigated will turn into a tangible trade war - and to the point of striking parallels in history. What led to the outbreak of trade wars in the past? Who is the winner, and who will lose in the battle for advantages in global trade? What really stands behind the astonishing renaissance of customs barriers and protectionism?

That’s a reality for thousands in Germany, who despite having a job cannot find a place to live. 

Attila Kokas works for the Berlin City Mission as a gardener. Denny Wagner is a cook. At an emergency shelter he prepares food for homeless people. For a few months now, Denny has been spending nights in a small, simple hut with no electricity. Attila sleeps on the street, before he makes his way to work in the early hours. Despite having jobs, both men have been unable to find an affordable apartment in Berlin. They share their fate with quite a few people in Germany. In larger cities in particular, the housing market is tight. This hits people emerging from homelessness and earning low wages especially hard. How can they get away from being without a roof?

Researchers like him want to look at the label, check out the copyright information, and note the catalogue numbers, he said."It has all this information there," Seubert said. "I don't even necessarily need to hear it," he continued, adding, "just seeing the physicality of it, it's like, 'Okay, now I know more about this record.'"Music publishers suing IA argue that all the songs included in their dispute—and likely many more, since the Great 78 Project spans 400,000 recordings—"are already available for streaming or downloading from numerous services.""These recordings face no danger of being lost, forgotten, or destroyed," their filing claimed.But Nathan Georgitis, the executive director of the Association for Recorded Sound Collections (ARSC), told Ars that you just don't see 78 RPM records out in the world anymore. Even in record stores selling used vinyl, these recordings will be hidden "in a few boxes under the table behind the tablecloth," Georgitis suggested. And in "many" cases, "the problem for libraries and archives is that those recordings aren't necessarily commercially available for re-release."That "means that those recordings, those artists, the repertoire, the recorded sound history in itself—meaning the labels, the producers, the printings—all of that history kind of gets obscured from view," Georgitis said.Currently, libraries trying to preserve this history must control access to audio collections, Georgitis said. He sees IA's work with the Great 78 Project as a legitimate archive in that, unlike a streaming service, where content may be inconsistently available, IA's "mission is to preserve and provide access to content over time."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>DRM User-Space API For Apple Silicon Graphics Posted For Review</title><link>https://www.phoronix.com/news/DRM-User-Space-API-Asahi</link><author>Michael Larabel</author><category>tech</category><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:57:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.phoronix.com/">Phoronix</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[While the Asahi AGX Gallium3D and Honeykrisp Vulkan drivers continue to be developed within mainline Mesa for supporting OpenGL and Vulkan with Apple Silicon M1/M2 SoCs, the necessary Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) kernel driver has yet to be upstreamed.

which was only released a few weeks ago!
Early adopters to integrate Kuzu-Wasm include Alibaba Graphscope, see: 1
and 2, and Kineviz, whose project will be launched soon.In this post, we’ll showcase the potential of Kuzu-Wasm by building a fully in-browser chatbot
that answers questions over LinkedIn data using an advanced retrieval technique: Graph
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG). This is achieved using Kuzu-Wasm
alongside WebLLM, a popular in-browser LLM inference engine that can
run LLMs inside the browser.A quick introduction to WebAssemblyWebAssembly (Wasm) has transformed browsers into general-purpose computing platforms.
Many fundamental software components, such as full-fledged databases, machine learning
libraries, data visualization tools, and encryption/decryption libraries, now have Wasm versions.
This enables developers to build advanced applications that run entirely in users’
browsers—without requiring backend servers. There are several benefits for building fully
in-browser applications:y: Users’ data never leaves their devices, ensuring complete privacy and confidentiality.: An in-browser application that uses Wasm-based components
can run in any browser in a completely serverless manner.: Eliminating frontend-server communication can lead to a significantly faster and
more interactive user experience.With this in mind, let’s now demonstrate how to develop a relatively complex AI application completely in
the browser! We’ll build a  chatbot that uses graph retrieval- augmented
generation (Graph RAG) to answer natural language questions. We demonstrate this using
Kuzu-Wasm and WebLLM.The high-level architecture of the application looks as follows:
The term “Graph RAG” is used to refer to several techniques but in its simplest form the term
refers to a 3-step retrieval approach. The goal is to retrieve useful context from a graph DBMS (GDBMS)
to help an LLM answer natural language questions.
In our application, the additional data is information about
a user’s LinkedIn data consisting of their contacts, messages, companies the user or their contacts worked for. Yes, you can download
your own LinkedIn data (and you should, if
for nothing else, to see how much of your data they have!).
The schema of the graph database we use to model this data will be shown below momentarily. First, let’s go over the 3 steps of
Graph RAG:Q Q: A user asks a natural language question Q, such as “Which of my contacts work at Google?“.
Then, using an LLM, this question is converted to a Cypher query, e.g., MATCH (a:Company)<-[:WorksAt]-(b:Contact) WHERE a.name = "Google" RETURN b,
that aims to retrieve relevant data stored in the GDBMS to answer this question.Q Context: Q is executed in the GBMS and a set of records is retrieved, e.g., “Karen” and “Alice”. Let’s call these retrieved records “Context”.(Q + Context)  A: Finally, the original Q is given to the LLM along with the retrieved context and the LLM produces a natural language answer A,
e.g., “Karen and Alice work at Google.”The schema for our personal LinkedIn data’s graph is shown below:Upload CSV Files: Users drag and drop their LinkedIn CSV files, which are stored in Kuzu-Wasm’s virtual file system.Initial Processing: Using Kuzu’s  feature, the raw CSVs are converted into JavaScript objects.Normalization: In JavaScript, we clean and standardize the data by fixing timestamps, formatting dates, and resolving inconsistent URIs.Data Insertion: The cleaned data is inserted back into Kuzu-Wasm as a set of nodes and relationships.Our code follows the exact 3 steps above. Specifically, we prompt WebLLM twice, once to create a Cypher query Q,
which is sent to Kuzu-Wasm.
We adapted the prompts from our LangChain-Kuzu integration,
with a few modifications. Importantly, we make sure to include the schema information of the LinkedIn database from Kuzu in the prompt, which helps the LLM better understand
the structure and relationships (including the directionality of the relationships) in the dataset.In this example, we represented the schema as YAML instead of raw, stringified JSON in the LLM prompt.
In our anecdotal experience, for Text-to-Cypher tasks that require reasoning over the schema, we find that LLMs tend do better
with YAML syntax than they do with stringified JSON. More experiments on such Text-to-Cypher tasks will be shown in future blog posts.It’s indeed impressive to see such a graph-based pipeline with LLMs being done entirely in the browser! There are, however, some caveats.
Most importantly, in the browser, resources are restricted, which limits the sizes of different components of your application.
For example, the size of the LLM you can use is limited. We tested our implementation on a MacBook Pro 2023 and a Chrome browser.
We had to choose the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-q4f32_1-MLC model (see here for the model card),
which is an instruction-tuned model in MLC format. The  format is the smallest of the Llama 3.1 models that has 8B parameters
(the largest has 450B parameters, which is of course too large to run in the browser).
For simple queries, the model performed quite well. It correctly generated Cypher queries for the LinkedIn data, such as:How many companies did I follow?Which contacts work at Kùzu, Inc?However, we saw that for more complex queries requiring joins, filtering, and aggregation, the model struggled to return a valid Cypher query.
It often produced incorrect or incomplete Cypher queries for questions like: “Who endorsed me the most times?“.
Token generation is also far slower than what you may be used to in state-of-the art interfaces,
such as ChatGPT. In our experiments, we observed a speed of 15-20 tokens/sec, so generating answers took on average, around 10s.We have deployed this demo so you can test it in your browser:Live Demo: Drag and drop your LinkedIn data dump into
the app and start querying your personal graph. The demo also visualizes your data in a node-link graph view using GitHub Repository: The source code is openly available so you can experiment with it further. If you see better results with different models/prompts, we’d love to hear it!Once the data is loaded, you can see a visualization that looks something like this:The key takeaway from this post is that such advanced pipelines that utilize graph databases and LLMs are now possible .
We expect that many of the performance limitations of today will improve over time, with the wider adoption of WebGPU,
Wasm64, and other proposals
to improve Wasm. LLMs are also rapidly getting smaller & better, and before we know it, it will be possible to use very advanced LLMs
in the browser. The next release of Kuzu will include a native vector index (it’s already available
in our nightly build; see this PR for how to use it!).
As a result, you can also store the embeddings of documents
along with actual node and relationship records to enhance your graph retrievals, entirely within Kuzu.
Using our upcoming vector index,
you’ll be able to try all sorts of interesting RAG techniques, coupled with Kuzu-Wasm, all within the browser while keeping your data private.
The sky is the limit!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Nancey Murphy - Arguing God from Moral Law?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kaBAxG6jxPU</link><author>Closer To Truth</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kaBAxG6jxPU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:01:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl9StMQ79LtEvlrskzjoYbQ">Podcast - Closer to Truth</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Like us on Facebook for daily videos, updates, announcements, and much more: https://shorturl.at/tak4l

But for those looking at upgrading from an existing EPYC 9004 series server and bound by the motherboard BIOS support and/or cooling/power capacity, 400 Watts is a sweet spot. Many of the existing platforms designed for EPYC 9004 Bergamo/Genoa(X) and now extended for EPYC 9005 Turin are limited to a 400 Watt TDP. With the prior AMD EPYC 9655 testing I have already shown off the great Zen 5 uplift when maintaining the same core counts as Zen 4, but even sticking to 400 Watts at the top-end is room for more. The EPYC 9845 is AMD's top-end SKU for 400 Watts or less that allows for 160 dense cores (320 threads) per socket compared to the 128 core EPYC 9754 Bergamo. Effectively the same power level and 25% more -- and better (Zen 5C) -- cores. Plus with EPYC Turin supporting the new AMD P-State CPU frequency scaling driver there is greater headroom in optimizing for power efficiency if so desired. Here is a look at how the AMD EPYC 9845 delivers a great leap to performance and power efficiency for those looking at a surprisingly robust upgrade from prior generation EPYC 9004.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Ukraine Military Aid: What the U.S. Provides vs. European NATO | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNwiJjdsimg</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/uNwiJjdsimg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 14:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. paused all U.S. military aid to Ukraine after a contentious meeting between Trump and Zelensky.

Autofocus systems have significantly improved the reliability and accuracy with which fast moving objects can be shot. Round four decades ago, the new level of convenience offered by autofocus lenses has made photography more accessible to the masses. Since their first release of an autofocus lens in 1981, Canon has constantly developed their lens technology using different approaches. Over time, Canon has introduced seven different autofocus motor technologies that will be presented here.In optics, focus describes the point at which incoming light rays converge and it is used synonymously as a concept of sharpness. Autofocus, by contrast, is a technology to automatically focus the lens at a desired subject. The autofocus detection system inside the camera determines the ideal focusing lens position and instructs the lenses autofocus drive accordingly. In 1987, Canon has introduced both the EOS camera system and EF lenses which have been designed with autofocus as standard features. There have been some Canon autofocus lenses available before that date, but these have been discontinued with the introduction of EF lenses. For this reason, this chapter concentrates on all autofocus motor types that are used in EF, EF-S, EF-M, RF, and RF-S lenses that are marketed still today.The autofocus group of lens elements always shifts along the optical axis in a linear way. While focusing automatically, the movement is generated by some type of actuator. Autofocus actuators can basically be divided into two categories: These generate a rotation that is translated into a linear sliding motion via precision mechanics. One common transmission type uses a focusing barrel with helical slots. The focusing group of lens elements is engaged with these slots and slides forwards or backwards axially when the helical slot barrel is turned. Another possible transmission type uses a lead screw with a lead nut that connects to the focusing group of lens elements. Also called direct-drive systems. These perform a sliding movement that does not have to be translated. The focusing group of lens elements is directly connected to the linear actuator.The first types of autofocus drive systems used rotary movement and these include the Arc-Form Drive, Ring-Type USM, DC Micro Motor, Micro USM, Micro USM II, and Stepper Motor. Later, the switch was made to linear drives which include the Nano USM and the Voice Coil Motor. The following comparison chart shows all of the autofocus drive types that have ever been used in Canon's EF, EF-S, EF-M, RF, and RF-S lenses.The date indicates when a particular type of motor was first used in a lens. While some of the early types like the Arc-Form Drive have been discontinued, most other types are still in use today.If an autofocus Canon lens has no indication on its barrel about the autofocus technology used, the lens either has an AFD or DC Micro Motor installed.Note how the indication on lens barrels is often just USM but the exact type of built-in motor can be different. This is because Canon's USM autofocus drive system comprises several different mechanism families, the ring-type USM, the Micro USM (I and II), and the linear Nano USM. All USM drives use piezoelectric technology but with some variations.The introduction date of Canon's STM autofocus motor coincides with the introduction date of their EF-M mount system. All of Canon's EF-M lenses are equipped with the Stepper Motor technology.Full-Time Manual Focus (FTM) Override One key differentiator between these technologies is the capability of a lens to allow full-time manual (FTM) focus override. The ring-type ultrasonic Motor was the first autofocus system that allowed FTM focus override. Until 2012, most other lenses did not offer this type of manual focusing while autofocus is activated. The latest types of autofocus drives, including the Stepper Motor, Nano USM, and Voice Coil Motor, offer focus-by-wire. This is a concept where the manual focusing ring on the lens barrel is not mechanically coupled with the focusing group of lens elements but electronically controls the autofocus drive. Lenses that use focus-by-wire always offer full-time manual focus override.Arc-Form Drive (AFD)1987 - 1990Originally, the designation AFD stood for autofocus drive. Later, when other autofocus drive systems were introduced, the term was changed into Arc-Form Drive.The Arc-Form Drive was the first autofocus motor that was used in EF lenses. The assembly included the motor unit, the gear drive, and a transmission that allowed the user to switch between manual focusing and autofocusing. The AFD assembly was shaped like an arc so that it could easily be installed inside a cylindrical lens barrel.Lenses with Arc-Form DrivesCanon EF 15mm F2.8 Fisheye (1987)Canon EF 24mm F2.8 (1988)Canon EF 28mm F2.8 (1987)Canon EF 50mm F1.8 (1987)Canon EF 50mm F2.5 Compact Macro (1987)Canon EF 135mm F2.8 Softfocus (1987)The illustration shows an Arc-Form Drive inside a Canon EF 50mm F2.5 Compact Macro lens. The unit is driven by a 2-phase bipolar asymmetric stepper motor that consists of a stator core, two electromagnetic coils (each coil is also referred to as a phase), and a permanent magnet rotor. The bipolar construction of the motor allows current to flow through each coil in both directions. The term asymmetric refers to the shape of the stator that is not rotationally symmetric as in conventional stepper motors (but it is axially symmetrical though).The motor drives a reduction gear train that has the purpose of reducing the output gear's speed but at the same time increase the torque of that gear. A lever is used to shift the output gear in one of two possible positions where it either engages with the gear train or with the manual input gear that is connected to the manual focusing ring of the barrel.Two feedback systems are used to monitor the drive unit during operation. One system is used to confirm proper rotation of the rotor and another system is used to measure the number of turns the unit has performed:Two hall effect sensors are placed very closely at the rotor. These can detect changes in magnetic fields and are therefore used to confirm rotor movement.An optical encoder wheel with alternating black and reflective zones is attached to one of the gears. An infrared reflective sensor is placed so that it can read the number of steps that the encoder wheel turns (each transition between two zones is a step). This provides crucial feedback to the lens controller as autofocus instructions typically include a predefined number of steps an autofocus motor has to move into a certain direction.The illustration is a front view of the stepper motor with the cover removed. The rotor has two magnetic polarities opposite to each other, north and south. The stator consists of two phases that are colored in cyan and green for reasons of better explainability. The stator cores run through the phase coils to conduct the electromagnetic flux towards the rotor.During autofocus operation, the wire coils are excited via electrical impulses, which in turn magnetizes the stator core. The polarity of the voltage applied to the two coils is changed in a pre-defined sequence. The rotor performs a complete rotation in four steps:Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized so that the left part of the stator core is magnetized, attracting the rotor to perform a rotation. (This is a 90 degree clockwise rotation if the previous step of the motor was step 4.)Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized so that the right part of the stator core is magnetized. This attracts the rotor so that it performs a 90 degree clockwise rotation. Phase B coil is turned off. Phase A coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the left part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. The rotor is attracted again so that it performs another 90 degree clockwise rotation.Phase A coil is turned off. Phase B coil is energized with opposite polarity. This magnetizes the right part of the stator core again, but this time with opposite magnetic polarity. This induces the rotor to perform another 90 degree clockwise rotation.The sequence of steps is repeated as long as the rotor is required to turn. If the sequence is run in reverse from step 4 to step 1, the rotor turns counter-clockwise. The diagram summarizes these four steps.The AFD motor was designed with a transmission element that is also the output gear, the one that actually drives the helical focusing barrel. Note how the focusing barrel has a wide gear rim along its perimeter that allows the transmission element to shift a certain amount while always remaining engaged with the focusing barrel. The metal lever is connected to the MF/AF switch on the lens barrel and it shifts the transmission element so that it connects the output gear either with the motorized gear train or with the manual input gear. If the output gear is connected to one option, it is disengaged from the other option. For that reason, the Arc-Form Drive does not have full-time manual focus override available.In terms of overall performance and usability, the Arc-Form Drive is considered to be noisy during operation and slower than other autofocus drives. When following moving subjects, the system shows a noticeable reaction time. Lenses with an Arc-Form Drive have to sequentially focus and then stop down the aperture diaphragm. All other lenses with different autofocus motors are able to operate the autofocus motor and aperture diaphragm at the same time. Despite these weaknesses, AFD lenses still offer reliable autofocusing performance.Ring-Type Ultrasonic Motor (USM)1987 - PresentCanon's ultrasonic motors are very exceptional types of actuators. They neither have electromagnetic coils or magnetic rotors, so their motion is not generated by magnetism like in traditional motors. Instead, they use an ingenious combination of piezoelectric effects and friction. Introduced in November 1987 with the Canon EF 300mm F2.8L USM lens, the ring-type USM was the first implementation of this piezoelectric technology in photographic lenses, and in the years that followed, some different types of USM drives would appear.Canon's ring-type ultrasonic motor – as the name suggests – is shaped like a ring and, for that reason, fits perfectly inside the lens barrel. The optical system of the lens runs through the opening of that construction. At the time of its advent, this new technology was groundbreaking in its design and functionality, being ultra-fast and silent. They provide a high level of torque powerful enough to move even heavy groups of focusing lens elements inside super-telephoto lenses. Due to their high torque, no speed-reducing gear train is required when connecting the motor to the focusing mechanism. The ring-type USM has high holding torque maintained at zero input power and offers low inertia from its rotor providing rapid start and stop characteristics. In addition, this type of drive technology is unaffected by electromagnetic fields.The ring-type USM can be divided into the rotor, the piezoelectric stator, and various support rings.The rotor is the only part of this motor that actually rotates around the optical axis while the USM is in operation. The rotor itself is a compound of metal and plastic parts bonded together. The rotor has a sliding rail on the side facing the stator.The stator is an elastic metal body. In this context, elastic refers to the ability of the stator to oscillate to a certain extent, similar to a tuning fork. The stator has a ring of piezoelectric ceramic elements welded to its back (away from the rotor). Once this layer is electrically excited, it sets the stator into vibration. The vibrational energy is then transferred into the rotor via friction. Apart from its vibration, the stator does not move.A felt ring is used to protect the sensitive piezoelectric layer from the metal support rings that are pressed against the stator, and to dampen the vibrations from being transmitted into the lens barrel.The ring-type USM motor only works when the stator is firmly pressed against the rotor. The compression spring is what exerts this pressure on both the stator and rotor. This spring is an important part that ensures proper functionality of the ring-type USM.the lock ring is an interface part that holds all parts of the unit tightly together. Three indents on the inner circumference of the lock ring slide into slots of an inner lens barrel, securing the ring in place.The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the ring-type USM when it is fully assembled. The piezoelectric layer is what generates vibrations. A flex cable connects the piezoelectric elements with the lens circuit board, and therefore provides power to this element. Once the unit is installed inside a lens barrel, a dedicated contact surface on the rotor pushes against wheels on an output ring (not shown in this illustration) that ultimately drives the focusing mechanism.The compression spring creates a tension that is also referred to as preload force. Flat surface finishes of the sliding rail and the stator teeth ensure a good friction coefficient between rotor and stator. The preload force and the friction between the rotor and the stator determine the passive holding torque of the motor at zero power input.Canon uses stator rings of two different sizes. The medium sized stator has an outer diameter of 62 mm, and the larger sized stator has an outer diameter of 77 mm. There is a huge number of Canon lenses that use ring-type ultrasonic motors as their autofocus drives. The following list is only a very short excerpt:Canon EF 200mm F2.8 L II USMCanon EF 400mm F2.8 L IS USMCanon EF 600mm F4 L IS USMThe Piezoelectric Ceramic RingThe operation of the motor requires the stator to vibrate in a very precise way. This vibration is generated by a segmented piezoelectric ceramic ring that is welded to the back of the elastic stator body. The illustration of the piezoelectric array shows the distribution and configuration of piezo elements on the ring.The individual piezo elements are grouped together into groups A and B. Each group can be energized individually, and set the ring into vibration to form a standing wave with wavelength λ. Two piezo elements cover one full wavelength λ, and therefore each single piezo element has a length of λ/2. One of the key factors to ensure proper wave excitation in the stator is that both piezo groups are offset by λ/4 as shown in the illustration. This is also referred to as a spatial phase shift of λ/4.Piezoelectric ceramic elements are sandwiched between two electrodes. Electrode 1 is in direct contact with the metal stator ring and serves as ground (GND). In the following illustration, the lower electrodes of all piezo elements are covered by a layer of silver conductive adhesive so these elements are electrically connected to one group.The piezoelectric ceramic elements have the property to deform when an electrical field is applied, an effect also described as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The direction in which piezo elements deform is defined by their piezoelectric polarization, expressed via positive and negative signs in this slightly simplified diagram. Depending on the polarity of the voltage applied across the electrodes, the individual piezo elements bend upwards or downwards. As piezo elements are arranged with alternating piezoelectric polarities, energizing the piezoceramic layer shapes the stator into a waveform. When the electrodes are subject to an alternating voltage of high frequency, the stator ring begins to oscillate. The amplitude of these oscillations is as small as 1-2 µm.Piezo Group A is EnergizedFor the sake of better understanding, the two piezoelectric groups are viewed from the top, and energized separately. Piezo group A is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase A) while piezo group B remains de-energized. This not only generates a standing wave across group A but the wave unfolds across the entire stator ring. Looking at a snapshot in time, hollow circles indicate valleys in the stator, whereas solid black circles indicate peaks in the stator. Note how the peaks and valleys are exactly at the center of each piezo element of group A, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. Over the course of one sine oscillation, peaks will turn into valleys and back into peaks. At the same time valleys turn into peaks and back into valleys. A clear standing wave is formed only if the excitation frequency is equal to the natural flexural vibration resonant frequency of the stator. The resonant frequency of Canon's ring-type USM is approximately 27,000 Hz (oscillations per second). This frequency is in the ultrasonic range, which is why this type of autofocus technology is called ultrasonic. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase A generating a standing wave.Piezo Group B is EnergizedNow piezo group B is fed by a distinct sinusoidal voltage (phase B) while piezo group A remains de-energized. Again, a standing wave is generated and unfolds across the entire stator ring. This time, peaks (hollow circles) and valleys (solid black circles) are at the center of each piezo element of group B, whereas on the opposite side of the ring, peaks and valleys are exactly between the piezo elements. This shows that the two standing waves generated by group A and B are not congruent. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of phase B generating a standing wave.Both Groups are EnergizedWhen both piezo groups are energized at the same time, their vibration-induced standing waves are combined and form a new wave. When phase A and phase B are shifted by a quarter of a sine wavelength λ – called a temporal phase shift of λ/4 – the resulting wavelength is a traveling wave. This temporal phase shift can be achieved, for example, by using a sine wave for phase A and a cosine wave for phase B. Unlike a standing wave, the peaks and valleys of a traveling wave move around the circumference of the stator ring similar to waves on the surface of water. This traveling wave is the source of the motor’s rotational energy. Enlarging the illustration shows an animation of both phases generating a traveling wave. The sign of the temporal phase shift determines the propagating direction of the traveling wave, and  consequently also the rotating direction of the rotor. The stator has teeth cut into the material, and these are designed to amplify the movement of the ring.Not all piezo elements on the stator ring are used to generate waves. One small piezo element is located between the wave-generating piezo groups A and B and it serves as a sensor to measure the intensity of stator oscillations. Like all other piezo elements, the sensor element is sandwiched between two electrodes 1 and 2 (not shown in the illustration). Electrode 1 is directly connected to the metal stator body and serves as ground, whereas electrode 2 is on the opposite side and connects to the sensor line.It was described earlier that applying a voltage to a piezo element generates a deformation of that element, referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The actual (non-inverted) piezoelectric effect, however, is that pressure or deformation (such as bending) of the piezo element will generate an electric voltage. Consequently, the piezo's electrical output reflects the wave amplitude of the stator at its location. This signal is picked up by the control circuitry and can be used to adjust the frequencies of phases A and B accordingly.This feedback control system is required to monitor the proper excitation of the stator ring, and to achieve maximum amplitude of the traveling wave. The maximum amplitude can only be attained when the wave-generating phases precisely hit the natural resonance frequency of the stator body. That natural resonance frequency may vary from unit to unit due to small production related variations in dimensions, and for a given unit the natural resonance will vary with the temperature of the stator.The illustration of the stator ring's electric connections shows a piece of flex cable (copper wire traces laminated onto a thin film) attached to the back of the stator ring.
                
            All piezo elements – both wave generating elements and the sensor element – have electrodes that are in direct contact with the conductive stator ring. The GND wire is directly connected to the metal stator body, and therefore all piezo elements share the metal body as a common ground connection. The phase A wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the first piezo element of group A, and a thin film of silver conductive adhesive electrically connects all other elements of phase A with the first element. The phase B wire is connected to phase B in a similar way. The sensor wire is connected to the exposed electrode of the sensor element.Inactive Stator – Excited StatorThe following illustration shows 3D models of the ring-type USM stator. On the inactive stator ring, all teeth are in the same plane, allowing the stator to rest flat on the rotor. In this flat condition, the focusing lens group is automatically held in place due to the strong friction (similar to a disc brake). Once the stator is excited, it forms a traveling wave, here greatly exaggerated for the sake of clarification. The number of waves per cycle depends on the configuration of piezo elements. In this example, there are nine waves per cycle, but Canon also uses stators that form seven waves. The number n of waves formed on the stator means that one particular wave peak requires n excitation periods to completely travel around the stator one time.Traveling Wave of the USM StatorThe animation shows nine waves traveling across the stator ring in a very slowed-down form. It is clearly visible that the stator itself does not turn around its axis but only the peaks and valleys move as it performs this undulating vibration.The generation of a traveling wave can be considered as the first step in a two-step energy conversion process. The second step is the stator teeth transmitting their vibrational energy into a unidirectional continuous movement of the rotor via friction. Looking very closely at the stator teeth, the traveling wave induces elliptical motions at the tips of each tooth. In the animation, only one elliptical path of one tooth is shown, but all the other teeth carry out identical elliptical motions. Where the traveling wave forms peaks, the teeth are pressed against the rotor and push it in the direction of the elliptical motion. As a result, the rotor moves in the opposite direction of the traveling wave.It can be calculated how fast the traveling wave propagates. It is assumed in this example that 27,000 Hz  is exactly the natural resonance frequency of the stator ring. With nine peaks formed across the stator, it requires nine excitation periods for one peak to completely run around the stator ring one time. Thus, if the excitation frequency is at 27,000 Hz, one peak will travel a full revolution around the stator ring 3,000 times per second. Although the peaks travel at an extremely fast speed, the speed of the rotor is comparatively low. The rotor typically turns at a rate of 70-90 revolutions per minute, if excited continuously. The speed can be lowered by exciting the stator via pulse-width modulation. The microscopic oscillations of the tooth tips are the reason why the ratio between rotor speed and traveling wave speed is very low. This low ratio is actually an advantage as no speed-reducing gearbox is required, and the rotor can be directly coupled to the focusing mechanism of the lens barrel.The Working Principle SummarizedThe ring-type ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into an undulating motion by the piezoelectric elements of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations at around 27 kHz are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator.The traveling wave is generated by two main factors: Two groups of piezoceramic elements must be arranged with a spatial phase shift of λ/4, and these two groups must be energized with a temporal phase shift of λ/4. The elliptical motion of the stator teeth is transferred into the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.
            Friction between stator and rotor.Although being extremely well suited for photographic camera lenses, these motors show some drawbacks:This type of motor is not designed for continuous operation. Due to the friction involved, its life expectancy is lower than that of conventional electric motors.Although the ultrasonic noise cannot be perceived by the human ear, it can be picked up by sensitive microphones which can be problematic during video shootings.Ring-type USM motors are comparatively expensive to produce: The stator ring including all of its teeth are precisely cut by CNC milling machines. The production and application of piezoceramics is another difficult process. In addition, this type of autofocus motor requires complex power supply and driving circuits including high frequency generation and feedback control system.It was described in the beginning of this chapter that the ring-type ultrasonic motor was the first autofocus system that allowed full-time manual focus override. This is not a function of the ultrasonic drive unit itself, but rather of the cleverly designed differential mechanism.The challenge with the implementation of full-time manual focusing in general is that the user must be able to manually override the autofocus system (by turning the focusing ring on the barrel) without forcing the motor or grinding the gears. The ring-type USM prevents this from happening via an additional output ring that connects to the focusing group of lenses via a link bracket. Once this output wheel is turned, the focusing group adjusts the focusing distance of the lens. They key feature of this output ring is that it has three small wheels installed along its outer periphery. These wheels are sandwiched between the two input options – the manual input ring and the motor input ring (the USM stator). This is a rotary differential mechanism, and it allows either one of these input options to turn the output ring without exerting a force on the other input option. For that reason, the manual focusing ring can be turned without forcing the rotor into any direction. Due to this rotary differential, full-time manual focusing has become a standard feature on all lenses with a ring-type ultrasonic motor.The following illustration shows the output wheel with its small carrier wheels. The top right shows a schematic of both input options (manual input and motor input) and how they are arranged in the lens barrel. Note that due to the differential construction the output wheel does not turn at the same speed as the input wheels, but at a speed defined by the formula: v =   where v refers to the speed of the manual input ring and v refers to the speed of the motor input ring. If one of the input rings is not moving (which is normally the case), the output speed v is half of the input speed.This diagram is a front view of the rotary differential mechanism. It is clearly visible how the mechanical link is established between the output ring and the focusing lens cell. As the differential mechanism turns around the lens axis, the focusing lens cell is shifted forward or backward, while still remaining engaged with the link bracket via the connecting handle. To ensure smooth movements, Canon uses some lubrification on the sliding elements.DC Micro Motor1990 - 2012The DC Micro Motor – sometimes abbreviated MM – looks quite similar to the AFD motor. It has almost an identical shape. In addition, the DC Micro Motor also uses a reduction gear train to transmit the motor's power to the focusing lens barrel. However, the type of motor itself is different. Instead of a stepper motor as used in the AFD, this type of autofocus drive uses an ultra-compact direct current (DC) motor. This is an extremely common type of motor, and it is considered to be the least advanced autofocus motor used in Canon lenses along with the AFD. Canon primarily uses the DC Micro Motor in entry-level autofocus lenses. Here are some examples of lenses that use this type of drive system:Canon EF-S 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 (2003)Canon EF-S 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 II (2005)Canon EF 50mm F1.8 II (1990)Canon EF 75-300mm F4-5.6 (1991)Canon EF 75-300mm F4-5.6 II (1995)Canon EF 75-300mm F4-5.6 III (1999)Once power is supplied to a direct current motor, the rotor starts to turn very fast. For that reason, the gear train attached to the motor uses a high reduction ratio to lower the speed of rotation. At the same time, rotational torque is increased towards the output gear.The DC Micro Motor has a lever to shift one gear between two positions. One position closes the gear train so that the motor's rotation is forwarded to the output gear, and the other position interrupts the transmission of rotational force. A tiny metal spring holds this switching gear under slight pressure so that it remains in its default position engaged with the other gears. Only when the AF/MF switch on the barrel is moved to the MF position, the lever shifts the switching gear so that it disconnects from its adjacent gears, disconnecting the motor from the output gear. This type of transmission shows that the DC Micro Motor does not support full-time manual focus override.An exploded view of the DC Micro Motor shows some more details of the unit. The rotor shaft is connected to a small pulley which drives another pulley via a rubber belt. This belt drive helps reduce vibrations that might be induced by the motor's operation. The larger pulley is connected to the first gear of the reduction gearbox. An encoder wheel with numerous tiny openings alongside its perimeter is attached to the first gear. Each transition between an opening and solid material is one step of the encoder wheel. A sensor runs an infrared beam through one of these openings, and records the signal on the other side. Once the wheel is turned, the signal is interrupted until the next opening where the signal is recorded again. This setup allows the lens electronics to count the number of steps the encoder wheel has turned and thus how far the focusing lens group has been moved.The exact type of motor is a 2-pole 3-coil brushed DC motor. The description 2-pole refers to the two connection terminals at the back of the motor. These connections directly lead to the two metal brushes that touch the rotor's commutator from opposite sides. This is how electrical power is supplied to the rotor. The description 3-coil indicates that the rotor has three coil windings attached to its metal core. Each of these coils is an electromagnet that can change its polarity.The following schematic shows the electrical configuration of the rotor. The commutator has three separate contact surfaces, and these are connected to the windings as depicted. As the brushes are 180 degrees apart, they only form electrical connections with two of the contact areas at a given time. This design is the key requirement for the coils to form correctly oriented magnetic fields.The DC Motor in OperationThe two power terminals of the DC motor are energized with an operating DC voltage between 4 and 6 volts. The metal brushes pass on this voltage to the commutator, which in turn applies that voltage to the coils. The magnetic fields produced at each coil are either repelled or attracted by the stator's permanent magnets. Due to the commutator's design and the wiring configuration, each coil changes its electrical (and therefore magnetic) polarity as soon as it has reached maximum proximity to a permanent magnet. This switches the coils from being attracted to being repelled, ensuring a continuous rotation. This principle allows a small DC motor to run at speeds up to 6.000 rpm. When the voltage polarity of the brushes is reversed, the rotor turns in the opposite direction.The advantage of the DC Micro Motor is that it runs on a DC voltage, and therefore does not require any complex driver electronics such as a stepper motor. Nevertheless, the control circuitry must be capable of handling comparatively large currents. Due to its limited torque, the DC Micro Motor is almost always used in compact lenses with smaller and lighter focusing lens groups. Another disadvantage of this autofocus drive is its relatively noisy operation. Nevertheless, it is a reliable autofocus system that is embedded in numerous Canon lenses.Micro USM and Micro USM II1992 - 2016The Micro USM and Micro USM II are different members of Canon's ultrasonic motor family. The first generation Micro USM was introduced in 1992. Ten years later in 2002, the second generation Micro USM II followed with an ultra-compact design half the size of the original version.Canon's Micro USM actuators are small-diameter (11 mm) cylindrical ultrasonic motors using piezoelectric ceramic elements to generate oscillations. Compared to the ring-type USM, the Micro USM uses an ultra-compact design. The original Micro USM version has an overall length of 26.7 mm whereas the Micro USM II is just 13.4 mm long. Both versions of the Micro USM have an output gear that engages with a speed-reducing and torque-increasing gearbox that is connected to the focusing cam barrel.The Micro USM motor in general is a stack of different parts pressed together via a metal shaft. The motor can be divided into the rotor, the stator, and some auxiliary parts and support structures. The attachment flange is usually described as the top of the unit.The illustration shows an exploded view of the Micro USM unit (original version) inside a Canon EF lens.A flexible metal shaft has threads cut into both ends so that retaining nuts and discs can be screwed on to hold the entire stack of parts together. An attachment flange is used on the top of the motor to allow the Micro USM to be installed in the gearbox of the autofocus mechanism.The metal rotor has two slots on one side where it engages with two protrusions on the surface of the output gear wheel. Therefore, every movement of the rotor is transmitted directly to the output gear wheel. On the opposite side, the rotor has a tiny lip (seen on the cross-sectional view) where it forms a pressure contact with one of the stator's oscillators. The pressure is formed by a small spring that is directly pushing onto the rotor from the top side.The stator consists of a laminated piezoelectric element (LPE) that is sandwiched between two oscillators. These oscillators are cylindrical metal bodies that are pressed flat against the adjacent parts. The stator's oscillator 2 is held in place by a threaded disc. This threaded disc is omitted on the Micro USM II, as in this version the oscillator 2 is designed with an own thread.The Principle of OperationBoth versions of Micro USM autofocus drives use piezoelectric elements to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. While this principle is similar to the ring-type USM, the Micro USM type of motors use an entirely different stator design. 
                
            The Laminated Piezoelectric Element (LPE)The Micro USM uses piezoceramic discs to generate ultrasonic vibrations in the stator. As the vibrations of each individual disc are extremely small in amplitude, a stack of round 25 discs is laminated to a solid piezoceramic part. The resulting multi-layer cylindrical unit is called the laminated piezoelectric element (LPE). The illustration is a schematic view of one piezoceramic disc.The two halves of these discs have been polarized in opposite directions. Each disc has four electrodes attached to either side, two on each half. This allows the discs to be energized in two phases A and B. If an electric voltage is applied to one phase, the electric field that forms across the electrodes causes one quarter of the disc to expand and one quarter to contract. This electrically induced deformation of piezoceramic material is referred to as the inverse piezoelectric effect. The reaction of piezoceramic material is roughly 10 times higher in the expanding way rather than in the contracting way. In the illustration, the level of deformation is hugely exaggerated to illustrate the principles involved.The illustration shows the arrangement of discs inside the laminated piezoelectric element, and how electrical power is supplied to each disc. Layers with even numbers have their A+/- and B+/- electrodes on their top, while layers with uneven numbers (except for the first one) have AG and BG electrodes on their top. Each disc has a number of through-holes, tiny conductive paths that establish electrical connections between the different layers. Note how some electrodes are shaped with recesses so that there is enough space for through-holes into deeper layers of the stack. The discs and through-holes are arranged so that energizing the A-phase (applying a voltage between the A and AG contacts) will energize all the A-phase portions of all discs at the same time. The same applies for the B-phase. This synchronized activation of all discs causes a uniform deformation of the entire LPE. Electrical power is provided via a thin sheet of printed circuit board that is pressed against the top surface of the LPE, establishing a connection to all of the through-holes of that first disc. The individual layers are not visible to the naked eye.With the LPE sandwiched between the two oscillator bodies, energizing the LPE with a sinusoidal voltage causes the oscillators to vibrate. Vibration is amplified by exciting the stator with the natural resonance frequency of the oscillators which is in the ultrasonic range. The illustration shows how the stator vibration even causes a lateral displacement of the stator body.Both Phases are EnergizedThe two phases of the LPE are energized with high-frequency voltages that are shifted by λ/4 (temporal phase shift). The resulting vibrations from each phase combine and generate a nutation motion of the stator around its axis. This nutation forms a peak at the top surface of the larger oscillator that moves around the circumference similar to a traveling wave. The amplitude of that oscillation movement is as small as two micrometers, and therefore not visible to the naked eye. The oscillator has a small lip on its surface that is in pressure contact with the rotor.The animation shows the nutation movement of the stator. The rotor and output gear, among other parts, are not shown here to most clearly illustrate the movement. The nutation is slowed down and greatly exaggerated in amplitude. Note that the stator itself does not rotate around its axis but only the peak on the top surface of the larger oscillator travels in a circular way. This traveling wave (one peak and one valley) is the source of rotational energy that is transferred into the rotor via friction.This animation shows the complete Micro USM unit in operation. The principle of transferring the stator's energy into the rotor is similar to the frictional coupling used by the ring-type USM motor. The Micro USM rotor is in pressure contact with the top surface of the elastic body. Proper operation is achieved only when the stator is excited at the exact resonance frequency of the elastic metal bodies, which amplifies vibrations and thus energy transfer into the rotor. Although the Micro USM stator has no teeth cut into the oscillator body, the traveling wave exerts frictional force in the opposite direction of the nutation motion. This principle of frictional coupling is very similar to the ring-type USM. The animation shows that the rotor and output gear perform actual rotations around their axis, and their direction of rotation is opposite from the direction of the stator's traveling wave.The Working Principle SummarizedThe cylindrical ultrasonic motor operates a two-stage energy conversion process: In a first stage, electrical energy is converted into a nutation motion of the stator. In a second stage, these ultrasonic vibrations are converted into a continuous unidirectional rotating movement of the rotor by friction on the stator. The stator vibrations are generated by a multi-layer laminated piezoelectric element that is excited via two separate phases that are excited with a λ/4 phase-shifted sinusoidal voltage, generating the nutation mode. The stator's energy is transferred to the rotor due to friction between the stator and rotor, caused by the pressure contact (preload force) between stator and rotor.This summary is similar in many respects to the summary of the ring-type USM motor. While the Micro USM and ring-type USM share the same general principles, they are still different types of motors. Here is a comparison of the similarities and the differences between the Micro USM and the ring-type USM:Both types of motors use piezoelectric elements to generate flexural vibrations in the stator, as well as ultrasonic excitation to maximize vibrations in the oscillators. A traveling wave is generated at the surface of the stator, and friction is used to turn the rotor in the opposite way than the traveling wave. Both types are inaudible by the naked ear, but their noise can be picked up by sensitive microphones during video recordings. Neither of them is intended for long-term operation.Ring-type USM and Micro USM types of autofocus drives use completely different stator geometries. Also, their piezoceramic elements are arranged in different ways. The stator of a ring-type USM forms seven to nine traveling waves whereas the stator of a Micro USM performs a nutation motion that is similar to a single traveling wave (one peak and one valley). The overall size of the Micro USM is considerably smaller than the ring-shaped USM. Output speed is relatively high on the Micro USM, and therefore a gearbox is used to lower the speed of the output gear. Overall production cost is comparatively low for the Micro USM and Micro USM II, which is why these types of motors have been used for the low- and mid-level lenses.The following illustration shows two gearboxes used to connect Micro USM and Micro USM II motors to the focusing groups of lenses. Some examples of Canon lenses that use Micro USM and Micro USM II technology include:Canon EF 70-300mm F4-5.6 IS USMCanon EF 90-300mm F4.5-5.6 USMCanon EF 28-105mm F4-5.6 USMCanon EF-S 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 II USMStepper Motor (STM)2012 - PresentIn June 2012, Canon announced the EF 40mm F2.8 STM and the EF-S 18-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS STM lenses. These were the first lenses that carried the designation STM in their name, an abbreviation that stands for stepper motor. Although the technology had already been used in the Arc-Form Drive, the stepper motor inside STM lenses has a clearly different design including a greatly reduced size.Stepper motors are rotary drives that convert electrical energy into rotational energy of the motor shaft. Canon uses two different transmission types to convert the rotary motion into linear motion of the focusing lens groups: This type of transmission uses a worm drive to side the focusing lens unit axially along two guide rails. This type of transmission uses gear wheels and is ultimately connected to a focusing barrel with helical slots. Once that internal barrel is turned, the focusing lens unit is shifted along the lens axis.While these are different types of transmissions, the actual stepper motors used are identical. Canon STM lenses offer very quiet and smooth autofocus operation. For that reason, the STM autofocus system is considered a good choice for both photography and video shooting. The STM system has become widely used not only in Canon's EF and EF-S series of lenses but also in their latest RF and RF-S lenses. Here is a short list of lenses that use the STM autofocus system:Canon EF 40mm F2.8 STM (2012)Canon EF-S 24mm F2.8 STM (2014)Canon RF 28-70mm F2.8 IS STM (2024)Canon RF-S 18-45mm F4.5-6.3 IS STM (2022)The type of stepper motor used in STM lenses is a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor with permanent magnet rotor. Unlike the AFD stepper motor, the STM version uses a rotationally symmetrical stator. First, the general principle of stepper motor operation is shown, and then the actual design of Canon's stepper motors is examined.The following illustration shows the general principle of a 2-phase bipolar stepper motor. The term 2-phase refers to the use of two separate coils. The description bipolar indicates that each of these coils can be energized with current flowing in two different directions, allowing each coil to generate two opposite magnetic field polarities. The ferromagnetic metal parts of the stator pointing towards the rotor are called field poles. The coil windings of both phases are split into two portions and are wound around opposite field poles to ensure simultaneous magnetization during operation. Each phase is labeled with two letters, one of them overlined to indicate the polarity in which the magnetic field is generated. Once phase A is energized, the magnetic polarity of field pole A and field pole Ā (Inverse-A) is always opposite from each other. The same applies for the second phase. In the illustration, the letters are also used to describe the polarities at which the voltage is applied to the coils.In this simplified example, the stator consists of four field poles, two per phase, which results in a rather large step angle of 90 degrees. During operation, the two phases are energized as shown in the timing diagram below. Note how due to inverted polarities, the two coils are capable of generating four different magnetic field orientations, and the stator strictly follows these orientations. This mode of operation is called full-step mode. Four full steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. The stepper motor can also be driven in half-step mode where between full-steps both phases are turned on at the same time, turning the rotor by 45 degrees. Eight half-steps are required to complete one turn of the rotor. In the context of autofocus systems, however, speed is more important than increasing the step precision, and therefore the half-step mode is not discussed further.Stepper Motor with Can-Stack DesignThe type of stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses has 20 field poles, 10 per phase. This quantity of field poles makes it unpractical to apply coil windings directly at each field pole. For that reason, a very clever stator design is used:The two phase windings are stacked on top of each other as shown in the cutaway diagram. Each phase winding is surrounded by a steel shell, and triangular teeth (field poles) are brought to the center. These teeth are arranged in an alternating fashion, five coming from the bottom of each coil pointing upwards, and five coming from the top of each coil pointing downwards. Once a coil is energized, the steel shell carries the magnetic flux into the teeth, one polarity to the teeth pointing up and the opposite polarity to the teeth pointing down. As a result, the teeth form an alternating ring of north and south magnetic poles and will attract the permanent magnet rotor accordingly.Thanks to this design, one coil winding has a total of 10 field poles. Phase B is located below and has an equal number of 10 field poles. One key requirement of this design is that both rings of phase A and phase B stator teeth are offset by 18 degrees from each other. This is half the pitch between two teeth of one stator. This stepper motor construction is also referred to as can-stack design because it looks like a small stack of two steel cans. Another commonly used term is tin-can design.Once all teeth of phases A and B are combined, the stator consists of 20 field poles. The rotor is a ferrite ceramic cylinder that is magnetized in the 10-pole pattern shown (five north and five south poles). The stepper motor is operated via four repetitive steps:Step 1: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-A as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).Step 2: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as south poles (and Inverse-B as north poles). The rotor turns so that its five north poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five south poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).Step 3: Phase B is de-energized. Phase A is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled A are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-A as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's A poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-A poles).Step 4: Phase A is de-energized. Phase B is energized in reverse so that field poles labeled B are magnetized as north poles (and Inverse-B as south poles). The rotor turns so that its five south poles align with the stator's B poles (and the rotor's five north poles align with the stator's Inverse-B poles).After four steps, the rotor has completed a 72 degree turn, and thus it requires 20 steps to complete one full rotation. The direction of rotation can be reversed by performing the sequence of steps backwards. The rotor follows the magnetic fields so precisely that no separate feedback control system is required. The autofocus control system of the lens sends an instruction to the stepper motor driver to perform a certain number of steps. After the same number of electrical pulses to the phase coils, the rotor will have performed an equal number of steps into the desired direction.The can-stack is one of the most commonly used stepper motors designs. It is often used in scanners, printers, CNC mills, robots, and other devices. The illustration is an enlarged cutaway diagram of a stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses. This is an extremely small unit of just eight millimeters diameter (this is smaller than the DC micro motor). Due to this size, the STM drive is more suitable for smaller focusing lens elements. It is therefore unlikely to ever be used in heavy super-telephoto lenses.Full-Time Manual Focus OverrideCanon STM lenses use focus-by-wire as the coupling method between the manual focusing ring and the autofocus drive. For that reason, all STM lenses do support full-time manual focus override at any time.The following illustration is an exploded view of the stepper motor used in Canon's STM lenses. The long worm gear on the motor shaft is part of the lead-screw mechanism to move the focusing lens.The Nano USM autofocus drive is the latest addition to Canon's ultrasonic motor family. Canon announced the EF‒S 18‒135mm F3.5‒5.6 IS USM lens, the first Canon lens with the new Nano USM technology installed. In that same year, Canon discontinued the previous ultrasonic motor – the Micro USM.The Nano USM uses piezoceramic elements to generate vibrations that are translated into movement. The drive system does not generate rotational output, and therefore doesn't require a helical barrel or lead screw to translate rotation into linear movement. Instead, the Nano USM generates a linear movement that is directly forwarded to slide the focusing lens cell axially along guide rails. A position encoder with alternating dark and reflective stripes is attached to the focusing lens unit, allowing an infrared sensor to count the steps that the focusing mechanism has moved.The heart of the system is the Nano USM actuator. That is a tiny piece of elastic metal around 20 mm in length with piezoceramic elements attached to its lower side. The piezoceramic layer has three electrodes on the lower surface. Two small elevations on the top surface are in pressure contact with a stationary slide rail. The illustration summarizes this construction of the Nano USM actuator.Although being extremely small, the Nano USM actuator generates comparatively high levels of output torque. In addition, it offers very rapid start and stop characteristics and fast, well controllable output speed.During operation of the Nano USM drive, the USM actuator goes into two flexural vibration modes. Mode 1 is an out-of-plane bending mode that turns the actuator into a saddle-shape. Mode 2 is another out-of-plane bending mode that shapes the actuator into a waveform.Both modes are excited with high-frequency voltages in the range of the natural resonance frequency of the elastic metal body. The result is that both vibrational modes combine and generate an elliptical motion of the contact points. Due to the pressure contact between the Nano USM actuator and the stationary slide rail, the elliptical motion exerts a frictional force on the surface. It is the counterforce on the actuator that ultimately generates the linear movement of the Nano USM frame.The amplitudes of both bending modes are greatly exaggerated in the illustrations. In reality, the amplitudes are so small that no deformation can be seen during operation. Similarly, the ultrasonic frequencies involved in the excitation of the actuator are inaudible to the human ear, and unlikely to be picked up by microphones. Due to its slightly lower output power, the Nano USM is preferred when smaller groups of lens elements need to be moved.The image shows a complete Nano USM assembly including the frame, the actuator socket, the slide rail, and the silver bracket that holds down the Nano USM actuator via four tension springs.Full-Time Manual Focus OverrideCanon's lenses with Nano USM autofocus drives allow full-time manual focus override via focus-by-wire. There is no mechanical connection between the manual focusing ring on the lens barrel and the focusing lens group inside a Nano USM lens. This is similar to lenses with STM or VCM autofocus drives.Released in 2019, the Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM was the first lens to feature Dual Nano USM technology. The innovation with Dual Nano USM is that two of these compact ultrasonic drive systems are installed in the lens barrel. Each AF drive moves one of two internal focusing groups – one focusing group and one floating group. The image shows the Dual Nano USM system that is integrated inside the Canon RF 100-300mm F2.8 L IS USM lens, a high-end telephoto zoom lens.Voice Coil Motor (VCM)2024 - PresentThe voice coil technology has a long history that is tied to the history of telecommunication. The first voice coil was patented at the end of the 19th century, but it was in the 1920s when the first voice coils were actually installed in telephone speakers. A wire coil was attached to a paper diaphragm, and a magnet was placed inside the coil. The resulting device was a transducer that converted electronic signals into the voice of the caller. This type of use gave voice coils their names. Over the last decades, voice coils kept their name but got increasingly used for other applications including hard disc drives, robotics, precision instrumentation, as well as camera systems.Canon is already using voice coil motors for a long time to drive the image stabilization unit. Voice coil motors have also been used for decades as autofocus drives in cine lenses. This is ideal for video shootings because they are completely silent even in the ultrasonic range. Then, in 2024, Canon first used voice coil motors as the autofocus drives in their photographic lenses. The Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM was the first lens with a voice coil motor.Voice coil motors combine a range of advantages:Voice coil motors are very compact and lightweight in their design. This makes them suitable for applications where space is limited or weight constraints are critical.Fast response times: Unlike traditional motor technologies, such as DC or stepper motors, voice coil motors provide near-instantaneous response due to their direct electromagnetic actuation. In addition, their lightweight nature contributes to rapid acceleration and deceleration. This makes them an excellent choice for autofocus drives.Due to their high acceleration, the coil can reach a high speed very fast.High level of precision and accuracy: The design of voice coil motors allows for precise control and positioning, enabling the coil to be moved in sub-micrometer steps.Voice coils generate a high force output to move even very large focusing lens groups.Low power consumption: There are very low frictional losses due to the direct electromagnetic actuation. Therefore, voice coil motors have a very low power consumption which leads to extended battery life.Due to its linear design, no helical barrel or lead screw is required to translate rotation into linear movement. The voice coil is therefore directly connected to the focusing lens group.Voice coil motors are virtually silent even when recorded by sensitive microphones. This makes Canon's RF lenses with VCM autofocus drives perfect choices not only for photography but also for videography.The Principle of OperationThe image shows the VCM unit inside the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM lens. There are two identical voice coil motors attached to the focusing lens cell. This symmetrical construction prevents one-sided stress on the mechanism and therefore ensures a smooth sliding operation. Each voice coil is supported by a sliding rail that passes through its center and which defines the range of axial movement. On either side there are two strong permanent magnets placed above and below the voice coils so that their magnetic field runs through the coil.The following illustration is a cross-sectional view of the VCM unit. The voice coil is exposed to the stationary magnetic field of the permanent magnets at any time. Once a current runs through the wire coil, a force (called Lorentz force) is exerted on the coil so that it moves axially along the sliding rail. The force generated is proportional to the flux density of the magnetic field and the intensity of the electric current. The direction in which the Lorentz force acts is depending on the direction of the current. By applying ultra-short voltage pulses to the voice coil, the unit can be driven into the desired direction with an extreme level of precision.A slight drawback of the technology is that even when the focusing lens is not moved, the position control must be active in order to retain the coil's position.The use of voice coils in Canon's RF lenses made it possible to enter a new field. The smooth and silent operation of the VCM system not only convinces photographers but for the first time also satisfies the requirements of videographers. For that reason, Canon has introduced a new series of specially designed RF lenses, called hybrid lenses. These are L-lenses of the RF mount system that are specially designed to combine the benefits of photo and video technologies (such as a manual aperture ring normally found only on cine lenses). Some examples of these hybrid RF lenses include:Canon RF 24mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)Canon RF 50mm F1.4 L VCM (2024)The illustration is a transparent view of the Canon RF 35mm F1.4 L VCM hybrid RF lens. It can be seen that this lens is equipped with two autofocus drive systems. The pair of voice coil motors drives the main focusing lens group while a Nano USM unit drives the floating lens element.The following illustration is a block diagram of the same lens. Note that the main focusing lens group consists of four lens elements, a considerable weight that requires a powerful autofocus system. The two symmetrically arranged coils of the voice coil motor actually generate a significant force to even allow rapid movements of these focusing lenses. The floating lens is a single element only, and therefore the smaller Nano USM is a sufficiently powerful drive system.Back - FocusMain MenuNext - Aperture]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>#IoannisKolaxis on what #SoftwareEngineers can do to help prevent #ClimateChange</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQusBKCyTiI</link><author>GOTO Conferences</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/NQusBKCyTiI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 13:00:36 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs_tLP3AiwYKwdUHpltJPuA">GOTO Conferences</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out the full version on our YouTube channel now! #GOTOcon #GOTOams #Sustainability #SustainableSoftware #SustainableProgramming #CarbonEfficiency #Efficiency #HumanFactor #IoannisKolaxis #Atos #DataNetworks #Containers #Decarbonization #Serverless #AWSLambda #AzureFunctions #GoogleCloudFunctions #GreenCloud #GreenComputing #GreenCoding #Programming #GreenSoftware #Viral #ViralShorts #GOTO

When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.When the tail-call interpreter was announced, I was surprised and impressed by the performance improvements, but also confused: I’m not an expert, but I’m passingly-familiar with modern CPU hardware, compilers, and interpreter design, and I couldn’t explain why this change would be so effective. I became curious – and perhaps slightly obsessed – and the reports in this post are the result of a few weeks of off-and-on compiling and benchmarking and disassembly of dozens of different Python binaries, in an attempt to understand what I was seeing.At the end, I will reflect on this situation as a case study in some of the challenges of benchmarking, performance engineering, and software engineering in general.I also want to be clear that I still think the tail-calling interpreter is a great piece of work, as well as a genuine speedup (albeit more modest than initially hoped). I am also optimistic it’s a more robust approach than the older interpreter, in ways I’ll explain in this post. I also really don’t want to blame anyone on the Python team for this error. This sort of confusion turns out to be very common – I’ve certainly misunderstood many a benchmark myself – and I’ll have some reflections on that topic at the end.In addition, the impact of the LLVM regression doesn’t seem to have been known prior to this work (and the bug wasn’t fixed as of publishing this post, although it since has been); thus, in that sense, the alternative (without this work) probably really was 10-15% slower, for builds using clang-19 or newer. For instance, Simon Willison reproduced the 10% speedup “in the wild,” as compared to Python 3.13, using builds from .Here are my headline results. I benchmarked several builds of the CPython interpreter, using multiple different compilers and different configuration options, on two machines: an Intel server (a Raptor Lake i5-13500 I maintain in Hetzner), and my Apple M1 Macbook Air. You can reproduce these builds using my  configuration, which I found essential for managing so many different moving pieces at once.All builds use LTO and PGO. These configurations are:: Built using Clang 18.1.8, using computed gotos. (Intel only): Built with GCC 14.2.1, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using computed gotos.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, using the new tail-call interpreter.: Built using Clang 19.1.7, computed gotos and some  tuning flags which work around the regression.I’ve used  as the baseline, and reported the bottom-line “average” reported by /. You can find the complete output files and reports on github.Observe that the tail-call interpreter still exhibits a speedup as compared to clang-18, but that it’s far less dramatic than the slowdown from moving to clang-19. The Python team has also observed larger speedups than I have (after accounting for the bug) on some other platforms.You’ll notice I didn’t benchmark the tail-call interpreter on the older Clang release (what would be ). The tail-call interpreter relies on new compiler features which only landed in Clang 19, meaning we can’t test it on earlier versions. This interaction, I think, is a big reason this story was so confusing, and why it took me so many benchmarks to be  I understood the situation.A classic bytecode interpreter consists of a  statement inside of a  loop, looking something like so:Most compilers will compile the  into a jump table – they will emit a table containing the address of each  block, index into it with the opcode, and perform an indirect jump.It’s long been known that you can speed up a bytecode interpreter of this style by replicating the jump table dispatch into the body of each opcode. That is, instead of ending each opcode with a , each opcode contains a separate instance of the “decode next instruction and index through the jump table” logic.Modern C compilers support taking the address of labels, and then using those labels in a “computed goto,” in order to implement this pattern. Thus, many modern bytecode interpreters, including CPython (before the tail-call work), employ an interpreter loop that looks something like:For performance reasons (performance of the compiler, not the generated code), it turns out that Clang and LLVM, internally, actually merges all of the s in the latter code into a  LLVM instruction, which each opcode will jump to. That is, the compiler takes our hard work, and deliberately rewrites into a control-flow-graph that looks essentially the same as the -based interpreter!Then, during code generation, LLVM performs “tail duplication,” and copies the branch  into each location, restoring the original intent. This dance is documented, at a high level, in an old LLVM blog post introducing the new implementation.The whole reason for the deduplicate-then-copy dance is that, for technical reasons, creating and manipulating the control-flow-graph containing many  instructions can be quite expensive.In order to avoid catastrophic slowdowns (or memory usage) in certain cases, LLVM 19 implemented some limits on tail-duplication pass, causing it to bail out if duplication would blow up the size of the IR past certain limits.Unfortunately, on CPython those limits resulted in Clang leaving all of the dispatch jumps merged, and entirely undoing the whole purpose of the computed -based implementation! This bug was first identified by another language implementation with a similar interpreter loop, but had not been known (as far as I can find) to affect CPython.In addition to the performance impact, we can observe the bug directly by disassembling the resulting object code and counting the number of distinct indirect jumps:I am confident that the change to the tail-call duplication logic caused the regression: if you fix it, performance matches clang-18. However, I can’t fully explain the  of the regression.Historically, the optimization of replicating the bytecode dispatch into each opcode has been cited to speed up interpreters anywhere from 20% to 100%. However, on modern processors with improved branch predictors, more recent work finds a much smaller speedup, on the order of 2-4%.We can verify this 2-4% number in practice, because Python still supports the “old-style” interpreter, which uses a single  statement, via a configuration option. Here’s what we see if we benchmark that interpreter (".nocg" for “no computed gotos” in the following table):Notice that " is only 2% slower than , even though the base  build is 9% slower! I interpret that “2%” as a fairer estimate for the cost/benefit of duplicating opcode dispatch, alone, and I don’t fully understand the other one.I haven’t mentioned the  benchmark, which you may notice claims to be  than " It was at this point that I discovered an additional, and very funny, twist to the story.I explained earlier that Clang and LLVM:Compiles the  into a jump table and an indirect jump, very similar to the one we create by hand using computed gotosCompiles computed gotos into a control-flow graph that closely resembles the classic  graph, which a single instance of the opcode dispatch, andIs able to reverse the transformation during codegen in order to duplicate the dispatchThose facts taken together, might lead you to ask, “Couldn’t we just start with the -based interpreter, and have the  do tail-duplication, and get the same benefits?”clang-18 (or clang-19 with appropriate flags), when presented with the “classic” -based interpreter, goes ahead and duplicates the dispatch logic into each the body of each opcode anyways. Here’s another table, showing the same builds with the number of indirect jumps, using the  test from earlier:Thus, there’s a case to be made that the entire “computed goto” interpreter turns out to be entirely unnecessary complexity (at least for modern Clang). The compiler is perfectly capable of performing the same transformation itself, and (apparently) the computed gotos don’t even suffice to guarantee it!That said, I did also test GCC, and GCC (at least as of 14.2.1) does not replicate the , but does implement the desired behavior for when using computed goto. So at least in that case we see the expected behavior.LLVM pull request 114990 merged shortly after I published this post, and fixes the regression. I was able to benchmark it before merge and confirm it restores the expected performance.For releases before that fix, the PR that caused the regression added a tunable option to choose the threshold at which tail-duplication will abort. We can restore similar behavior on clang-19 by simply setting that limit to a very large number.I will freely admit that I got nerdsniped quite effectively by this topic, and have gone far deeper than was really necessary. That said, having done so, I think there are a number of interesting lessons and reflections to be taken away, which generalize to software engineering and performance engineering, and I will attempt to extract and meditate upon some of them.When optimizing a system, we generally construct some set of benchmarks and benchmarking methodology, and then evaluate proposed changes using those benchmarks.Any set of benchmarks or benchmark procedures embeds (often implicitly) what I like to call a “theory of performance.” Your theory of performance is a set of beliefs and assumptions that answer questions like “which variables (may) effect performance, in what ways?” and “what is the relationship between results on benchmarks and the “true” performance in “production”?”The benchmarks ran on the tail-call interpreter showed a 10-15% speedup when compared with the old computed-goto interpreter. Those benchmarks were accurate, in that they were accurately measuring (as far as I know) the performance difference between those builds. However, in order to generalize those specific data points into the statement “The tail-call interpreter is 10-15% faster than the computed-goto interpreter, more generally,” or even “The tail-call interpreter will speed up Python by 10-15% for our users,” we need to bring in more assumptions and beliefs about the world. In this case, it turns out the story was more complex, and those broader claims were not true in full generality.(Once again, I really don’t want to blame the Python developers! This stuff is  and there are a million ways to get confused or to reach somewhat-incorrect conclusions. I had to do ~three weeks of intense benchmarking and experimenting to reach a better understanding. My point is that this is a very general challenge!)This example highlights another recurring challenge, not only in software performance, but in many other domains: “What baseline do you compare against?”Any time you propose a new solution or method for some problem, you typically have a way of running your new method, and producing some relevant performance metrics.Once you have metrics for  system, however, you need to know what to compare them against, in order to decide if they’re any good! Even if you score well on some absolute scale (assuming there  a sensible absolute scale to evaluate), if your method is worse than an existing solution, it’s probably not that interesting.Typically, you want to compare against “the current best-known approach.” But sometimes that can be hard to do! Even if you understand the current approach in theory, you may or may not be an expert in applying it in practice. In the case of software this may mean something like, tuning your operating system or compiler options or other flags. The current-best approach may have published benchmarks, but they’re not always relevant to you; for instance, maybe it was published years ago on older hardware, and so you can’t do an apples-to-apples comparison with the public numbers. Or maybe their tests were run at a scale you can’t afford to replicate.I work in machine learning at Anthropic these days, and we see this all the time in ML papers. When a paper comes out claiming some algorithmic improvement or other advance, I’ve noticed that the first detail our researchers ask is often not “What did they do?” but “What baseline did they compare against?” It’s easy to get impressive-looking results if you’re comparing against a poorly-tuned baseline, and that observation turns out to explain a surprising fraction of supposed improvements.On software engineering One other highlight, for me, is just how complex and interconnected our software systems are, and how rapidly-moving, and how hard it is to keep track of all the pieces.If you’d asked me, a month ago, to estimate the likelihood that an LLVM release caused a 10% performance regression in CPython and that no one noticed for five months, I’d have thought that a pretty unlikely state of affairs! Those are both widely-used projects, both of which care a fair bit about performance, and “surely” someone would have tested and noticed.And probably that  situation was quite unlikely! However, with so many different software projects out there, each moving so rapidly and depending on and being used by so many other projects, it becomes practically-inevitable that  regressions “like that one” happen, almost constantly.The saga of the computed-goto interpreter illustrates recurring tensions and unresolved questions around optimizers and optimizing compilers, to which we don’t yet have agreed-upon answers as a field.We generally expect our compilers to respect the programmer’s intent, and to compile the code that was written in a way that preserves the programmer’s intent.We also, however, expect our compilers to optimize our code, and to transform it in potentially-complex-and-unintuitive ways in order to make it run faster.These expectations are in tension, and we have a dearth of patterns and idioms to explain to the compiler “why” we wrote code in various ways, and whether we were  trying to trigger a certain output, or make a certain performance-related decision, or not.Our compilers typically only  to emit code with “the same behavior” as the code we write; performance is something of a best-effort feature on top of that guarantee.Thus, we end up in this odd world where clang-19 compiles the computed-goto interpreter “correctly” – in the sense that the resulting binary produces all the same value we expect – but at the same time it produces an output completely at odds with the intention of the optimization. Moreover, we also see other versions of the compiler applying optimizations to the “naive” -based interpreter, which implement the exact same optimization we “intended” to perform by rewriting the source code.In hindsight, it appears that the “computed goto” interpreter, at a source code level, and “replicating the dispatch at a machine-code level” end up being almost-orthogonal notions! We’ve seen examples of every instance of the resulting 2x2 matrix! Because all of those  binaries compute the same values when run, our current tools are essentially unable to talk about the distinctions between them in a coherent way.This confusion is one way in which I think the tail-calling interpreter (and the compiler features behind it) represent a genuine, and useful, advance in the state of the art. The tail-call interpreter is built on the  attribute, which represents a relatively new kind of compiler feature.  does not affect the “observable program behavior,” in the classic sense that compilers think, but is rather a conversation with the ; it requires that the compiler be able to make certain optimizations, and requires that compilation fail if those optimizations don’t happen.I’m hopeful this framework will turn out to be a much more robust style for writing performance-sensitive code, especially over time and as compilers evolve. I look forward to continued experiments with features in that category.Concretely, I find myself wondering if it would be viable to replace the computed-goto interpreter with something like a (hypothetical) [[clang::musttailduplicate]] attribute on the interpreter  loop. I’m not expert enough in all the relevant IRs and passes to have confidence in this proposal, but perhaps someone with more familiarity can weigh in on the feasibility.I want to close with a call-out of how helpful  was for this project. I have been experimenting with nix and NixOS for my personal infrastructure over the last year or so, but they turned out to be a total lifesaver for this investigation.In the course of these experiments, I have built and benchmarked  of different Python interpreters, across four different compilers (, , , and ) and using numerous combinations of compiler flags. Managing all of that by hand would have strained my sanity, and I’m  I would have made numerous mistakes during which I mixed up which compiler and which flags went into which build, and so on.Using , I was able to keep all of these parallel versions straight, and build them in a reproducible, hermetic style. I was able to write some short abstractions which made them very easy to define, and then know with absolute confidence  any given build in my  store came from, with which compilers and which flags. After a small amount of work to build some helper functions, the core definitions of my build matrix is shockingly concise; here’s a taste:I was even able to build a custom version of LLVM (with the bugfix patch), and do Python builds using that compiler. Doing so required all of about 10 lines of code.That said, not everything was rosy. For one,  is, by necessity, “weird” in various ways compared to the ways “normal people” use software, and I worry that some of that weirdness may have affected some of my benchmarks or conclusions in ways I didn’t notice. For instance, early on I discovered that nix (by default) builds projects using certain hardening flags that disproportionately impact the tail-call interpreter. I’ve handled that one, but are there more?In addition, Nix is incredibly extensible and customizable, but figuring out how to make a specific customization can be a real uphill battle, and involve a lot of trial and error and source-diving. My patched LLVM build ended up being pretty short and clean, but getting there required me to read a lot of  source code, mixing and matching two under-documented extensibility mechanisms ( and  – not to be confused with , used elsewhere), and one failed attempt which successfully patched , but then silently built a new  against the unpatched version.Still,  was clearly enormously helpful here, and on net it definitely made this kind of multi-version exploration and debugging  saner than any other approach I can imagine.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing Epomaker Cypher 98 &amp; Carbon60 keyboards!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPZ4jAiNNiw</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/kPZ4jAiNNiw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 06:00:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get them here:

In a demo video Limor 'Ladyada' Fried compares the LLM's command-line interface to working with the build-automation tool CMake or "a weird cross between IRC and a BBS." The first step was converting a PDF of the hardware's datasheet into text, and Claude Code first displays the appropriate Bash command, while asking "Do you want to proceed?" ("What's nice is that it doesn't make changes, even though it has write access to files in the directory...") Eventually from the data sheet it creates things like an accurate register map, C++ headers, and even license text — and more. 

"We are using it to automate parts of the coding and debugging process for an Arduino-compatible Metro Mini board with an OPT 4048 color sensor," writes ptorrone:
Using Claude Code's shell access, we can compile, upload, and test code in a semi-automated workflow, allowing the LLM to suggest fixes for errors along the way... While the AI isn't perfect for high-level driver development, it's proving VERY useful for tedious debugging and super-fast iterative improvements, bringing hardware automation closer to ...reality. 
In the video Fried describes it like this. "I have a full debugging cycle, where I'm there — I'm like driving the car — but I have this copilot that's telling me where to go..." 

"I feel like I'm getting closer to having a semi-automated way of doing driver development."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Sphinx</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-sphinx</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67c99971fc5f88b98d88db92/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=Ny2jz0WJhZWoGFy6wT3sHklkR2Hs2Bbxor5HoXtuSx4" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Great Sphinx of Giza is probably the most recognisable statue in the world but it’s also one of the most mysterious...with conflicting stories about who built it and why have circulated since ancient times.

It’s often a long way to travel to see a doctor, and treatment is expensive. But an organization from Germany is providing those affected with orthopedic aids, as well as training specialists.

In Uganda, people with disabilities not only often live in great poverty, there’s also hardly any medical care available to them. For more than 10 years now, an organization from Usingen in the German state of Hesse has been providing people with prostheses and other orthopedic aids. In the small town of Kiyunga near the capital Kampala, ProUganda has set up a center with a modern orthopedic workshop and treatment rooms.
But not everyone can get there: The roads are uneven and it’s difficult for poor families to get to Kiyunga with their children. That’s why the team travels to rural areas in minibuses. In the trunk: wheelchairs, some delivered second-hand from Germany, some bought with donations.
The film accompanies members of the aid organization as they work with patients in Kiyunga, in the workshop and on missions in the region.

The Evolving Agents Framework allows agents to:Reuse, evolve, or create new agents dynamically based on semantic similarity
Communicate and delegate tasks to other specialized agents
Continuously improve by learning from past executions
Define workflows in YAML, making it easy to orchestrate agent interactions
Search for relevant tools and agents using OpenAI embeddings
Support multiple AI frameworks (BeeAI, etc.)
Current Status & Roadmap
 This is still a draft and a proof of concept (POC). Right now, I’m focused on validating it in real-world scenarios to refine and improve it.Next week, I'm adding a new feature to make it useful for distributed multi-agent systems. This will allow agents to work across different environments, improving scalability and coordination.Why?
Most agent-based AI frameworks today require manual orchestration. This project takes a different approach by allowing agents to decide and adapt based on the task at hand. Instead of always creating new agents, it determines if existing ones can be reused or evolved.Example Use Case:
Let’s say you need an invoice analysis agent. Instead of manually configuring one, our framework:
 Checks if a similar agent exists (e.g., a document analyzer)
 Decides whether to reuse, evolve, or create a new agent
 Runs the best agent and returns the extracted informationHere's a simple example in Python:import asyncio
from evolving_agents.smart_library.smart_library import SmartLibrary
from evolving_agents.core.llm_service import LLMService
from evolving_agents.core.system_agent import SystemAgentasync def main():
    library = SmartLibrary("agent_library.json")
    llm = LLMService(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o")
    system = SystemAgent(library, llm)    result = await system.decide_and_act(
        request="I need an agent that can analyze invoices and extract the total amount",
        domain="document_processing",
        record_type="AGENT"
    )

    print(f"Decision: {result['action']}")  # 'reuse', 'evolve', or 'create'
    print(f"Agent: {result['record']['name']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())Next Steps
Validating in real-world use cases and improving agent evolution strategies
Adding distributed multi-agent support for better scalability
Full integration with BeeAI Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)
Better visualization tools for debugging

We human beings sit roughly midway between the sizes of atoms and galaxies, and both must be so perfectly structured for us to exist. It’s called ‘fine-tuning’ and it’s all so breathtakingly precise that it cries out for explanation. To some, fine-tuning leads to God. To others, there are non-supernatural explanations. Both are startling.

European markets rallied sharply this week as German borrowing costs soared after the country’s new leaders announced a historic deal to loosen its “debt brake” rule to boost spending on defense.

The interest rate on German government bonds saw their biggest daily increase since October 1998.

The Dax 30 index, which tracks the largest German companies, rose by 3.5% as stock prices also leapt in other European markets amid hopes that a massive boost in European spending on defense and infrastructure would kickstart the region’s lagging economy.

ABSTRACT
Randomness is essential for important applications such as the encryption of information. We know computers are bad at generating randomness, therefore much effort has been put into finding strategies to do this reliably and securely. These strategies can range from clever, to complex, to just outright silly.

In this talk, we'll cover a research project that aims to answer the question of whether an ant colony can serve as a source for seeding OpenSSL's random number generator. The process, challenges, and findings will be candidly discussed, with something in this presentation for everyone to take away. [...]

But the Trump administration has cut off vital support for their jamming capabilities, which could deprive the Ukrainian Air Force of a critical air countermeasure.However, as Forbes analyst David Ax writes , the Ukrainians are not powerless and can shift the burden of air jamming onto the French Dassault Mirage 2000 fighters.As Aks points out, the Ukrainian Air Force is taking full advantage of the ability of F-16s equipped with AN/ALQ-131 pods to flood Russian radar screens with electronic noise. They act as “flying air defenses” with advanced missile warning technology, notes the Conflict Intelligence Team.But the Russian Air Force can circumvent the jamming by reprogramming its radars to different frequencies. As Axe points out, while the Biden Air Force was able to keep up with the Russian adaptation by constantly tweaking the AN/ALQ-131 frequencies, under Trump, Ukrainian pilots are not receiving updates, and the programs could soon become obsolete.However, France’s Mirage 2000s are equipped with their own powerful jammers, and the Americans are not involved in their programming, the analyst notes.The Mirage 2000-5F currently in service with the French Air Force flies with a combination of the Serval radar warning receiver, Sabre jammer and Eclair flare dispenser. This system was cutting edge in the 1980s, but within a generation it was falling behind.“Recognizing this weakness and understanding the seriousness of the Russian missile threat over Ukraine, the French Ministry of Defense promised to install new electronic countermeasures on the Mirage 2000s before handing them over to Ukraine. The ministry probably had in mind the predominantly analog Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 2 or the all-digital Integrated Countermeasures Suite Mark 3,” Ax notes.Either system is an improvement over the older system and a potential replacement for the AN/ALQ-131, as the American pods lag behind the Russian adaptation. The French are firm allies of Ukraine and are willing to reprogram the jammers if necessary.In the longer term, the Ukrainians could refit their F-16s with non-American electronic countermeasures, Axe notes. But that could take time and money that Ukraine cannot afford.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Searchable Vim Cheat Sheet with Favorites (Open-Source)</title><link>https://nvim-cheatsheet.vercel.app/</link><author>lil_csom</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 10:05:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open file in new buffer, switch to it.

This is an amino acid analog that’s naturally found in tea, but now sold as a nutritional supplement for anxiety or mood or memory.Biologically speaking, it’s plausible. Theanine is structurally related to the neurotransmitter glutamate (theanine = C₇H₁₄N₂O₃, glutamate = C₅H₈NO₄-). For some reason, everyone is obsessed with stupid flashy dopamine and serotonin, and no one cares about glutamate. But it’s the most common neurotransmitter and theanine is both metabolized into glutamate and seems to itself have various complicated effects on glutamate receptors.Of course, there are lots of supplements that  act on the brain, but are useless when taken orally. That’s because your brain is isolated from your circulatory system by a thin layer of cells that are extremely picky about what they let through. But it appears that theanine  get through these cells and into the brain.So that sounds good. But do these low-level effects actually lead to changes in mood in real humans? When I looked into the academic research, I was surprised by how weak it was. Personally, on these kinds of issues, I find the European Food Safety Authority to be the single most trustworthy scientific body. They did an assessment in 2011 and found:Improvement of cognitive functioncause and effect relationship has not been establishedAlleviation of psychological stresscause and effect relationship has not been establishedMaintenance of normal sleepcause and effect relationship has not been establishedReduction of menstrual discomfortcause and effect relationship has not been establishedExamine is an independent website that’s respected for summarizing the scientific literature on health and supplements. They looked into if theanine helped with various things, like alertness, anxiety, and attention. In all cases found  for .A 2020 review of eight randomized double-blind placebo controlled trials found that theanine  help with stress and anxiety. While this review seems generally good, I found it to be insufficiently paranoid. One study they review found that theanine worked better than alprazolam (xanax) for acute anxiety. The correct response would be, “That’s , and the fact that normal scientific practices could lead to such a conclusion casts doubt on everything.” But the review sort of takes it at value and moves on.After 2020, the only major trial I could find was this 2021 study that took 52 healthy older Japanese people and gave them theanine (or placebo) for 12 weeks. They tested for improvements in a million different measures of cognitive functioning and mostly found nothing.I’ve long found that tea makes me much less nervous than coffee, even with equal caffeine. Many people have suggested theanine as the explanation, but I’m skeptical. Most tea only has ~5 mg of theanine per cup, while when people supplement, they take 100-400 mg. Apparently grassy shade-grown Japanese teas are particularly high in theanine. And I  find those teas particularly calming. But they still only manage ~25 mg per cup. (Maybe it’s because tea is better than coffee?)Still, I’ve supplemented theanine on and off for more than 10 years, and it seems helpful. So after seeing the weak scientific evidence, I thought: Why not do a self-experiment?Theanine seems ideal because it’s a supplement with short term effects. So you can test it against placebo. (Try that with meditation.) And you can build up a large sample using a single human body without waiting weeks for it to build up in the body before each measurement.Everyone agrees theanine is safe. It’s biologically plausible. While academic studies haven’t proven a benefit, they haven’t  one either. Given the vast  evidence, I saw a chance to stick it to the stodgy scientific establishment, to show the power of internet people and give the first rigorous evidence that theanine really works. Stockholm, prepare thyself.First, I needed placebos. This was super annoying. The obvious way to create them would be to buy some empty capsules and fill some with theanine and others with some inert substance. But that doesn’t sound fun. Isn’t the whole idea of modernity that we’re supposed to replace labor with capital?So I went searching for a pair of capsules I could buy off the shelf, subject to the following constraints:Capsule A contains 200 mg of theanine.Capsule B contains something with minimal acute effects on anxiety, stress, memory, concentration, etc.Capsule B contains something I don’t mind putting into my body.Both capsules are exactly the same size and weight.Both capsules are almost but not  the same color.Both capsules are made by some company with a history of making at least a modest effort to sell supplements that contain what they say they contain, and that don’t have terrifying levels of heavy metals.After a ludicrous amount of searching, I found that NOW® sells these veggie capsules: 200 mg L-Theanine 25 mcg (1,000 IU) Vitamin DThese are exactly the same size, exactly the same weight, exactly the same texture, and  close in color. They’re so close in color that under warm lighting, they’re indistinguishable. But under cold/blue lighting, the vitamin D capsules are  more yellow. Vitamin D might have some effects on mood, but no one seems to claim that they’re , that you’d feel them within an hour.For dosing, I decided to take a capsule whenever I was feeling stressed or anxious. Some people worry this invalidates the results. Not so! I’m still choosing randomly, and this better reflects how people use theanine in practice.Theanine is often recommended for reducing anxiety from caffeine. While I didn’t explicitly take caffeine as part of this experiment, I had almost always taken some anyway.Statistically, it would have been best to randomize so I had a 50% chance of taking theanine and a 50% chance of taking vitamin D. But I decided that would be annoying, since I was taking these capsules when stressed. So I decided to randomize so I got theanine ⅔ of the time and vitamin D ⅓ of the time.Randomization was very easy: I took two theanine capsules and one vitamin D capsule and put them into a little cup. I then closed my eyes, shook the cup around a bit and took one. I then covered the cup with a card.This picture shows one vitamin D capsule (top) and two theanine capsules.For each trial, I recorded my subjective starting stress level on a scale of 1-5, then set an alarm for an hour, which is enough to reach near-peak concentrations in the blood. After the alarm sounded (or occasionally later, if I missed it) I recorded the end time, my end stress level, and my percentage prediction that what I’d taken was actually theanine. Then, and only then, I looked into the cup. If the two remaining pills were different colors, I’d taken theanine. If not, it was vitamin D.After ~14 months, I got frustrated by how slowly data was coming in. This was the first time in my life I’ve had  much chill. At that point, I decided to start taking the capsules once or twice a day, even if I wasn’t stressed. I’ll show the transition point in the graphs below.Ultimately, I collected 94 data points, which look like this:Here are the raw stress levels. Each line line shows one trial, with the start marked with a tiny horizontal bar. Note the clear change when I started dosing daily:Alternatively, here’s the  in stress (end - start) as a function of time. If “Δ Stress” is negative, that means stress went down.Here are the start and end stress levels for each trial, ignoring time. The dotted line shows equal stress levels, so anything below that line means stress went down:Finally, here are the probabilities I gave that each capsule was in fact theanine.My stress level  usually go down, at least provided I was stressed at the start. But it went down regardless of if I took theanine or not. And I was  at guessing what I’d taken.Why did my stress decrease when I took vitamin D? Maybe it’s the placebo effect. But I suspect it’s mostly reversion to the mean: If you mark down the times in your life when you’re most stressed, on average you’ll be less stressed an hour later. You can see some evidence for this in that stress tended to decrease more when it started at a higher level.So, eyeballing the above figures, theanine doesn’t appear to do anything. (We can argue about statistics below.) Why? I think these are the possibilities:Theanine works, but I got fake theanine.Theanine works, but vitamin D works equally well.Theanine works, but I was unlucky.Theanine works, but I’m disembodied and unable to report my internal states.Theanine works on some people, but not me.It’s hard to disprove the idea that theanine works. But I tell you this: I expected it to work. And I  tried. For almost 100 trials over 16 months, I paid attention to what I was feeling and tried to detect  sign that I’d taken theanine, even if it wasn’t a change in stress. I could detect nothing. Even after months of failure, I’d often feel confident that  time I could tell, only to be proven wrong.Should I have been surprised by these results? Well, the scientific literature on theanine hasn’t found much of an effect. And the only other  self-experiment on theanine I’ve found is by Niplav, who found it did slightly worse than chance and declared it a “hard pass”.What about other blinded self-experiments with other substances? They’re surprisingly scarce, but here’s what I could find:Stimulants work! But for everything else…I particularly encourage you to read the sleep support post. He was confident it worked, he’d recommended it to lots of friends, but it totally failed when put to the test.I’ve seen  other self-experiments (including for theanine), but they’re non-blinded and I’d be doing you a disservice if I linked to them. People often mention that  this means the results aren’t scientific, but treat it like a small niggling technicality. It’s not.So I propose a new rule: Blind trial or GTFO.I know many people reading this probably use and like theanine. Maybe it works for you! But given the weak academic results, and given the fact that I actually did a blinded experiment, I think you now have the burden of proof. Doing this kind of test isn’t hard. If you’re sure theanine (or anything else) works, prove it.Appendix: OK fine let’s argue about statisticsDo you demand p-values? Are you outraged I just plotted the data and then started talking about it qualitatively?I think faith in statistics follows a U-shaped curve. By default, people don’t trust them. If you learn a  statistics, they seem great. (Particularly if you’re part of a community that’s formed a little cult around one set of statistical practices and convinced each other that they’re more reliable than they are.) But if you learn a  of statistics, then you realize all the assumptions that are needed and all the ways things can go wrong and you become very paranoid.If you want p-values, I’ll give you p-values. But first let me point out a problem.While I was blinded during each trial, I saw the theanine/D result when I wrote it down. Over time I couldn’t help but notice that my stress dropped even when I took vitamin D, and that I was terrible at predicting what I’d taken. So while this experiment is randomized and blinded, the data isn’t  or . If I did this again, I’d make sure I couldn’t see any outcomes until the end, perhaps by making 100 numbered envelopes, putting three capsules in each, and only looking at what was left at the end.But if you want to compute p-values anyway, OK! Here are the basic numbers for the trials when I took theanine:Stress went down, p < .0000001. But here are the the numbers for vitamin D:Technically, I did find two significant results. But the second row says that end stress was slightly  with theanine than with vitamin D, and the last row says that I gave slightly  probabilities that I’d taken theanine when I’d actually taken vitamin D.Of course, I don’t think this means I’ve proven theanine is harmful. I just think this confirms my general paranoia. To a first approximation, if it ain’t visible in the raw data, I ain’t going.Speaking of raw data, you can download mine here.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Happiest man alive</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5Qrt87Ab8U</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/i5Qrt87Ab8U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 00:52:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: I built an app to get daily wisdom from Mr. Worldwide</title><link>https://daale.club/</link><author>garyreckon</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sun, 9 Mar 2025 00:04:47 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Axiom Space and Red Hat Will Bring Edge Computing to the International Space Station</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/03/08/205225/axiom-space-and-red-hat-will-bring-edge-computing-to-the-international-space-station?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 22:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Axiom Space and Red Hat will collaborate to launch Data Center Unit-1 (AxDCU-1) to the International Space Station this spring. It's a small data processing prototype (powered by lightweight, edge-optimized Red Hat Device Edge) that will demonstrate initial Orbital Data Center (ODC) capabilities. 

"It all sounds rather grand for something that resembles a glorified shoebox," reports the Register.
 Axiom Space said: "The prototype will test applications in cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning (AI/ML), data fusion and space cybersecurity." 

Space is an ideal environment for edge devices. Connectivity to datacenters on Earth is severely constrained, so the more processing that can be done before data is transmitted to a terrestrial receiving station, the better. Tony James, chief architect, Science and Space at Red Hat, said: "Off-planet data processing is the next frontier, and edge computing is a crucial component. With Red Hat Device Edge and in collaboration with Axiom Space, Earth-based mission partners will have the capabilities necessary to make real-time decisions in space with greater reliability and consistency...." 

The Red Hat Device Edge software used by Axiom's device combines Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Red Hat Ansible Platform, and MicroShift, a lightweight Kubernetes container orchestration service derived from Red Hat OpenShift. The plan is for Axiom Space to host hybrid cloud applications and cloud-native workloads on-orbit. Jason Aspiotis, global director of in-space data and security, Axiom Space, told The Register that the hardware itself is a commercial off-the-shelf unit designed for operation in harsh environments... "AxDCU-1 will have the ability to be controlled and utilized either via ground-to-space or space-to-space communications links. Our current plans are to maintain this device on the ISS. We plan to utilize this asset for at least two years." 
The article notes that HPE has also "sent up a succession of Spaceborne computers — commercial, off-the-shelf supercomputers — over the years to test storage, recovery, and operational potential on long-duration missions." (They apparently use Red Hat Enterprise Linux.) "At the other end of the scale, the European Space Agency has run Raspberry Pi computers on the ISS for years as part of the AstroPi educational outreach program." 

Axiom Space says their Orbital Data Center is deigned to "reduce delays traditionally associated with orbital data processing and analysis."

By utilizing Earth-independent cloud storage and edge processing infrastructure, Axiom Space ODCs will enable data to be processed closer to its source, spacecraft or satellites, bypassing the need for terrestrial-based data centers. This architecture alleviates reliance on costly, slow, intermittent or contested network connections, creating more secure and quicker decision-making in space. 
The goal is to allow Axiom Space and its partners to have access to real-time processing capabilities, laying the foundation for increased reliability and improved space cybersecurity with extensive applications. Use cases for ODCs include but are not limited to supporting Earth observation satellites with in-space and lower latency data storage and processing, AI/ML training on-orbit, multi-factor authentication and cyber intrusion detection and response, supervised autonomy, in-situ space weather analytics and off-planet backup & disaster recovery for critical infrastructure on Earth.

    TypeLeap UIs detect your intent as you type, not just predict words. Using LLMs, TypeLeap understands what you want to do and dynamically adapts the interface in real-time.
    
    Instead of passive text input, TypeLeap offers proactive, intent-driven UIs. Think instant action suggestions, dynamic search results, and smarter commands, all based on understanding your typing intent.
    
    Faster, more intuitive workflows. Less mode switching. TypeLeap makes UIs truly responsive to your goals as you type.

  
    For years, we've been promised interfaces that are more intuitive, more… .  Autocomplete, suggestions, even Clippy (remember Clippy?) were early attempts. But with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), we're on the cusp of a genuinely new paradigm: .
  
    Imagine typing "weather in San…" into a search bar, and before you even hit enter, the interface dynamically shifts. Maybe a compact weather widget pops up, or the search results page subtly re-arranges to prioritize weather forecasts.  Or consider typing "remind me to call mom at 5pm" – instead of waiting for you to parse menus, the interface instantly presents a streamlined reminder creation form. This isn't just smarter autocomplete; it's the UI actively
    
    as you type and adapting in real-time.
  
    This concept, "TypeLeap," uses LLMs to analyze partial input and predict what the user is .  Are they searching for information? Issuing a command? Navigating somewhere?  Based on this dynamic interpretation, the UI proactively adjusts, offering context-aware actions and streamlining workflows.  Think of it as moving beyond static input fields to interfaces that feel genuinely responsive and anticipatory.
  It's Not Entirely New, But Now It's Different
    The core idea of dynamic, intent-aware inputs isn't entirely novel. We've seen glimpses in existing interfaces:
  
      A classic example. It merges URL and search, intelligently guessing your intent as you type. "Single word? Probably search." "Looks like a URL? Let's navigate."  It offers suggestions for both, adapting in real-time. Early debates even considered inline web results, but the focus remained on *accelerating input* with relevant suggestions, not overwhelming the user.
    Command Palettes (Like in VS Code or Slack):
      Start with a "/" in Slack or Ctrl+P in VS Code, and the input field transforms into a command interface.  Rule-based, yes, but illustrating intent-based mode switching. LLMs could generalize this, understanding natural language commands like "remind me to…" without needing a specific prefix.
    Real-Time Query Suggestions:
      Ubiquitous now, powered by statistical models. But imagine this amplified by LLMs. Arc Browser's "Arc Max" uses ChatGPT in the address bar to offer AI-generated answers alongside search completions.  Platforms like Nebuly offer "real-time prompt suggestions" in enterprise contexts.  The trend is clear: blending typing with AI assistance to predict intent and guide users.
    How Does This Actually Work? (The Tech Stack)
    Building TypeLeap UI/UX is a fascinating engineering challenge. The fundamental loop is: capture keystrokes -> LLM intent analysis -> UI update.  Crucially, this needs to be .
  Local vs. Server Processing:
    Sending every keystroke to a server for LLM analysis adds latency.  Enter . Projects like
    WebLLM
    are demonstrating that running moderately sized models directly in the browser (using WebGPU) is feasible.  Local analysis eliminates network latency and enhances privacy.  A hybrid approach might be best: a lightweight local model for initial intent guessing (within the first 50-100ms) to drive immediate UI hints, with heavier server-side analysis for deeper understanding or complex responses triggered concurrently.
  Optimizing for Speed is Paramount:
    Even local LLM inference needs optimization. Techniques like 
    (4/8-bit weights), 
    (smaller models trained on larger ones for intent classification), and 
    are essential.  For long queries, avoid re-analyzing prefixes – cache embeddings or intent decisions.  In client-server setups, .  The UI must
    
    real-time, even if heavy lifting is happening under the hood.  Think spinners, partial suggestions – visual feedback within a few hundred milliseconds.
  User Feedback and Control are Non-Negotiable:
    Dynamic UIs based on AI guesses require clear communication and user control.  Changes should be noticeable but not jarring. Subtle visual cues (highlights, ghost text) are key.  Major changes (like scheduling a meeting) should always require explicit user confirmation.  Easy dismissal or override options are crucial to prevent the UI from feeling unpredictable. Confidence scores from the LLM can gate UI changes – only trigger auto-updates when confidence is high.
  Debouncing is Your Friend (Backend Efficiency):
    Analyzing every keystroke is computationally wasteful. **Debouncing** is critical.  Wait for a short pause in typing (e.g., 300-500ms) before triggering LLM analysis.  This dramatically reduces unnecessary computations and API calls. Server-side throttling is also wise to handle rapid-fire requests.  Cancel or ignore redundant requests.  Chrome's omnibox analogy: background suggestion fetches stop when the user interacts with the dropdown.
  Use Cases: Beyond Search BarsTypeLeap UI/UX has broad applicability:Search Interfaces (Obvious, but Powerful):
    Differentiate between navigational queries ("facebook" -> go to site), informational questions (direct AI snippet answers), and action queries ("upload file" -> open upload dialog). Imagine typing "weather in San…" and a weather widget appears *as you type*. E-commerce search: "order status 12345" -> direct tracking UI. Browser address bars: factual question answers inline, direct command suggestions ("clear cache").  The search bar becomes a universal interface – navigation, chatbot, command line – all dynamically.
  Knowledge Management & Documentation:
    Internal wikis, note-taking apps. Differentiate between questions and keyword searches.  Natural language questions trigger FAQ mode; keywords trigger standard search.  Task-oriented intents: "create new page about…" -> template creation UI. Note-taking tools: AI suggests related info or links as you type. API documentation search: "how to use function X in Python" -> example snippet; "function X" -> reference docs.
  Interactive AI Assistants:
    Chatbots move beyond text. Detect intent in chat and invoke relevant UI. Customer support bot: typing about "refund policy" -> highlight policy article or present return form. Personal assistants: dynamic suggestions like "set an alarm for tomorrow?" and offer to open the Clock app. AI coding assistants: detect questions in comments ("how to sort a list in Python?") and proactively show answers/code snippets.  Blend chat and GUI: infer task intent and surface task-specific UI.
  LLM-Powered Software Tools (Everywhere):
    Project management: "assign Alice to write report by next Monday" in a text field -> task assignment with deadline in UI. Calendar: "Meeting with Bob next week about project" -> scheduling dialog with participants and date pre-filled.  CLIs: natural language commands "git, uh, create a new branch for feature X" -> parse to `git checkout -b feature_x` and show confirmation.  Even gaming/VR: analyze typed/spoken input for intent (command, chat, emote) and dynamically adjust game UI.
  This isn't magic.  Significant hurdles remain:
      LLMs aren't instant. Even milliseconds matter in typing interactions. Laggy suggestions are worse than no suggestions. Smaller/faster models or heavy optimization are mandatory. Computational cost is a real issue at scale. Design UIs to gracefully handle latency – placeholder hints ("searching…") are better than nothing.
    Accuracy of Intent Recognition:
      LLMs can misinterpret, especially with partial input. False positives (UI jumping to the wrong conclusion) are frustrating. Conservative confidence thresholds, disambiguation strategies, and fallbacks are needed.  Combine LLMs with heuristics.  Continuous learning from user corrections is essential.
    UI Stability and Predictability:
      Avoid "jittery" interfaces.  Users need to feel in control. Erratic UI changes erode trust.  Stable, predictable behavior is paramount.  Anchor UI changes (suggestions dropdown in the same place).  Carefully time updates. User testing is crucial to avoid unintended consequences of a "morphing" UI.
    
      Large models for nuanced intent are slow. Smaller models might be too simplistic. LLMs aren't truly real-time streaming (batch processing). Workarounds like prompting "what is the user likely trying to do?" add latency.  LLMs might be overkill for simple intent detection tasks.  Hallucinations and sensitivity to phrasing are still LLM limitations.
    
      Sending every keystroke to the cloud raises privacy concerns. Secure data transmission and careful handling of PII are minimum requirements. Local models mitigate this. Security is also a factor – prevent malicious input from triggering unintended commands. Sandboxing and confirmation for high-impact actions are needed.
    
    TypeLeap UI/UX is a compelling vision: interfaces that anticipate our needs, powered by the intelligence of LLMs.  From Chrome's omnibox to emerging AI-driven command bars, we see early examples.  For builders and tinkerers, the challenge is balancing AI power with performance, accuracy, and user expectations.  Techniques like debouncing, local inference, and confidence thresholds are crucial.
  
    When done right, TypeLeap UIs can feel remarkably natural – like the interface is an attentive assistant, understanding not just your words, but your *intent*. This is a fertile ground for innovation. Expect to see more experimentation in browsers, IDEs, assistants, and beyond.  The key, as always, is to use AI to *augment* user agency, not replace it.  The coming years will be fascinating as we explore the possibilities (and navigate the pitfalls) of interfaces that truly read our minds – as we type.
  I am unaware of any examples of this type of UI/UX in the wild. To be clear the criteria is a search/combo text input with UI elements that dynamically change based on the user's  as they type.Chrome's omnibox is the closest example I can think of. Any examples will be listed here.If anyone has design concepts which they would like to share, please let me know.I am looking for help with the following:Designers: This site/demo can use help with design of the page, and potentialy design mockups based on the concept of TypeLeap UI/UXDevelopers: This site/demo can use help with development of the site/demo]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kill your Feeds – Stop letting algorithms dictate what you think</title><link>https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/</link><author>tom_usher</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 18:11:46 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[
We are being boiled like frogs. It happened gradually, one algorithmic tweak at a time. What started as a way to connect with friends has become a system that gives the corporations that run social media control over what we consume and the ability to subtly shape how we think.
We used to control apps like Facebook and Instagram with our own choices. They became daily comforts, making the world seem a little bit smaller and closer by bringing the people that we cared about together in to one place.But from the perspective of these companies, that’s a problem. Our personal worlds, our friends, family, and connections, are finite. Once we’ve caught up, we put the app down. That’s bad for business.Social media companies need us flicking through their apps as long as they can keep us there. More eyes on ads is more money. So they play the system a bit. You’ve lingered on enough photos of cute puppies, they know what you like.Before long those feeds of finite content are replaced by infinite algorithmic content pulled from millions of users trying to optimise their posts to be picked up by the omnipotent algorithms. Algorithms which are completely opaque to us.Sci-fi imagines megacorporations controlling our minds with brain implants. Some worry that companies are already listening in. But they don’t have to - they already control our eyes.The creators of TikTok, Instagram etc. have gained control over exactly what we see. What we see strongly influences how we think. They know that their feeds make us angry, they know the negative effects on our mental health (particularly that of teens), and they know that they have an influence on our opinion.With the power to shape what we see comes the power to shape what we believe. Whether through deliberate manipulation or the slow creep of algorithmic recommendations, engagement is fueled by outrage, and outrage breeds extremism. The result is a feedback loop that isolates users, reinforces beliefs, and deprioritises opposing viewpoints.We live in times where being able to form our own opinion is more important than ever. Where knowing how to source and identify truthful information is a critical skill.Our reliance on being spoon fed ideas is destroying those abilities, Alec of Technology Connections calls this algorithmic complacency, referencing our increasing inability to look outside our algorithmically created bubble. The social media companies don’t care, the only person who has any interest in fixing this is you.It’s time to take back control of how we think. We’ve identified the problem, now it’s time to take action.We don’t all have the freedom, interest or willpower to delete social media from our lives entirely. It’s still where our friends are, an occasional distraction from reality and a source of entertainment. You don’t have to become a digital outcast to hold back this influence.Go directly to the source - if you like a particular TikTok creator, Facebook page or YouTube channel, skip the feed and go directly to their pages. Consider bookmarking their profiles individually.Learn to find information and entertainment without a feed - try to find a creator making videos or writing about a topic of interest without having to stumble across them in a feed.Use platforms and platform features that let you control your experience - Instagram’s ‘Following’ feed, YouTube’s Subscriptions page, Bluesky, Mastodon and RSS feedsBe mindful of engagement traps - recognise how algorithmic feeds are designed to keep you engaged and scrolling. Take a breath and stop the cycle.Talk about it - if you’re reading this you a already know this is a problem. Your friends and family may not be aware of how their feeds are manipulating their attention and beliefs. Without intervention, the radicalisation of opinions, and the consequences we’re already seeing, will only escalate.The internet should serve you, not the other way around. Take back control. Kill your feeds before they kill your ability to think independently.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The coronavirus pandemic and its consequences | DW Documentary</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oVToMh110U</link><author>DW Documentary</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/0oVToMh110U?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q">DW Documentary</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Covid-19 was officially declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020. The deadly disease spread so quickly around the world that it could not be contained with known measures. It was the beginning of a two-year state of emergency.

To many, it felt like something out of a disaster movie. This film relates how a number of people across Europe dealt with the crisis. Initially, the world was gripped by fear of this unknown virus that spread through the air that we breathe. In countries like Italy, the number of deaths rose so fast that medical personnel and undertakers were quickly overwhelmed. 

The public was sympathetic and supportive. People came out onto their balconies every evening to applaud the efforts of hospital staff. They were clapping for people like Carlo Mosca, a doctor in Brescia, Italy, who spent the first few months of the pandemic in hospital almost non-stop, caring for patients. Many of them died alone, as social distancing rules meant visitors were not allowed. Carlo Mosca didn’t see his family for months so as not to infect them.

When the first wave of the virus subsided, governments across Europe eased restrictions again. After a brief respite, further waves and restrictions followed, but by now, people were growing accustomed to the changes in their daily lives. However, things took a dramatic turn for Carlo Mosca. He was arrested in January 2021 and accused of murdering two patients with coronavirus to free up beds. Carlo Mosca had to remain under house arrest during the trial - while outside, life seemed to be returning to normal.

By now there was a general sense of relief - but it was short-lived. The number of infections shot up again in the fall. Many countries, including France, went back into lockdown. The film follows Aurélie Rhumeur as she and her husband Yves Chuop try to keep their Paris pharmacy running, home-school their daughter Cassandre and provide emotional support while keeping their own fears under control. Like all the protagonists in the documentary, Aurélie films herself - thus providing deep insight into a family life that is slowly disintegrating due to isolation and uncertainty over how long the state of emergency will last.

As the pandemic entered its second year, no one was applauding anymore. Expressions of solidarity gave way to those of frustration and anger. People across Europe took to the streets in anti-government protests, as conspiracy myths spread. Emotions were running high and only slightly eased by the development of a coronavirus vaccination. People were questioning the price they paid for efforts at protection against a deadly virus. Was it too high?

It's initially available on Pixel devices running Android 15 but will be expanded to "all sufficiently robust Android phones" when Android 16 arrives later this year," writes ZDNet's Steven Vaughan-Nichols. An anonymous reader shares an excerpt from the report: Today, Linux is only available on the latest Pixel devices running Android 15. When Android 16 arrives later this year, it's expected that all sufficiently robust Android phones will be able to run Linux. Besides a Linux terminal, beta tests have already shown that you should be able to run desktop Linux programs from your phone -- games like Doom, for example. The Linux Terminal runs on top of a Debian Linux virtual machine. This enables you to access a shell interface directly on your Android device. And that just scratches the surface of Google's Linux Terminal. It's actually a do-it-all app that enables you to download, configure, and run Debian. Underneath Terminal runs the Android Virtualization Framework (AVF). These are the APIs that enable Android devices to run other operating systems.
 
To try the Linux Terminal app, you must activate Developer Mode by navigating to Settings - About Phone and tapping the build number seven times. I guess Google wants to make sure you want to do this. Once Developer Mode is enabled, the app can be activated via Settings - System - Developer options - Linux development environment. The initial setup may take a while because it needs to download Debian. Typically this is a 500MB download. Once in place, it allows you to adjust disk space allocation, set port controls for network communication, and recover the virtual machine's storage partition. However, it currently lacks support for graphical user interface (GUI) applications. For that, we'll need to wait for Android 16.
 
According to Android specialist Mishaal Rahman, 'Google wants to turn Android into a proper desktop operating system, and in order to do that, it has to make it work better with traditional PC input methods and display options. Therefore, Google is now testing new external display management tools in Android 16 that bring Android closer to other desktop OSes.']]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The DOJ still wants Google to sell off Chrome</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/the-doj-still-wants-google-to-divest-chrome/</link><author>hydrolox</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:57:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The proposal, filed Friday afternoon, says that Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.” It also would require Google to stop paying partners for preferential treatment of its search engine.The DOJ also demands that Google provide prior notification of any new joint venture, collaboration, or partnership with any company that competes with Google in search or in search text ads. However, the company no longer has to divest its artificial intelligence investments, which was part of an initial set of recommendations issued by the plaintiffs last November. The company would still be required to give prior notification of future AI investments.“Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.”The DOJ formally brought its case against Google back in 2020, the most significant tech antitrust case since the DOJ’s years-long battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google has used anticompetitive tactics to protect its search dominance and forge contracts that ensure it’s the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones. Because of its hold on search, the lawsuit claimed, Google can adjust the auction system through which it sells ads and increase prices for advertisers, and rake in more revenue from that.Google has argued that its overwhelming success in search—it has a nearly 90 percent share in the US market—stems from the company offering the best search technology. It also says consumers are easily able to change their default search engine, and that Google does face competition from Microsoft and others.“DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security,” said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels in an emailed statement.Much of the ruling centered on the contracts Google has with device makers and browser partners, which use Google as their default search technology. According to Mehta’s ruling, around 70 percent of search queries in the US happen through portals in which Google is the default search engine. Google then shares revenues with those partners, paying out billions of dollars to them, which disincentivizes smaller search rivals who can’t compete with those contracts, Mehta said.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Strange Way We&apos;re Still Fighting The Black Death | Save Our Species | BBC Earth Science</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMD_Dpvy3TU</link><author>BBC Earth Science</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qMD_Dpvy3TU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 12:01:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdsOTr6SmDrxuWE7sJFrkhQ">BBC Earth Science</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Black Plague is still around today, and whilst it's incredibly rare that it affects humans, it can be a huge threat to animals.

Volkswagen also introduced haptic ‘sliders’ below the touchscreen for the heating and volume and it started using haptic panels instead of buttons for controls mounted on the steering wheel.More recently, the firm has reintroduced physical steering wheel buttons and Mindt said it is committed to reintroducing physical buttons, starting with the production version of the ID 2all concept that will arrive next year.“From the ID 2all onwards, we will have physical buttons for the five most important functions – the volume, the heating on each side of the car, the fans and the hazard light – below the screen,” said Mindt. “They will be in every car that we make from now on. We understood this.“We will never, ever make this mistake any more. On the steering wheel, we will have physical buttons. No guessing any more. There's feedback, it's real, and people love this. Honestly, it's a car. It's not a phone: it's a car.”Mindt said VW will continue to offer cars with touchscreens, in part due to new legal requirements that, as in the US, will require all cars to feature a reversing camera. “There are a lot of functions you have to deliver in certain areas, so the screen will be big and you will find a lot of HMI [human-machine interface] contents in the depths of the system,” he added. “But the five main things will always be on the first physical layer. That’s very important.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Show HN: Open-Source DocumentAI with Ollama</title><link>https://rlama.dev/</link><author>Dontizi</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Sat, 8 Mar 2025 02:12:13 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/shownew">HN Show</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Open-source project.

The risk was found to be overhyped — a mathematical error in the underlying research suggested a key chemical exceeded the safe limit when in fact it was ten times lower than the limit. Keen-eyed researchers quickly showed that an artificial intelligence (AI) model could have spotted the error in seconds.The incident has spurred two projects that use AI to find mistakes in the scientific literature. The Black Spatula Project is an open-source AI tool that has so far analysed around 500 papers for errors. The group, which has around eight active developers and hundreds of volunteer advisers, hasn’t made the errors public yet; instead, it is approaching the affected authors directly, says Joaquin Gulloso, an independent AI researcher based in Cartagena, Colombia, who helps to coordinate the project. “Already, it’s catching many errors,” says Gulloso. “It’s a huge list. It’s just crazy.”The other effort is called YesNoError and was inspired by the Black Spatula Project, says founder and AI entrepreneur Matt Schlicht. The initiative, funded by its own dedicated cryptocurrency, has set its sights even higher. “I thought, why don’t we go through, like, all of the papers?” says Schlicht. He says that their AI tool has analysed more than 37,000 papers in two months. Its website flags papers in which it has found flaws – many of which have yet to be verified by a human, although Schlicht says that YesNoError has a plan to eventually do so at scale. Currently, the YesNoError site lists errors which are not real and the initiative has not yet published a full account of how well the tool works.Both projects want researchers to use their tools before submitting work to a journal, and journals to use them before they publish, the idea being to avoid mistakes, as well as fraud, making their way into the scientific literature.The projects have tentative support from academic sleuths who work in research integrity. But there are also concerns over the potential risks, including that the tools could be used maliciously and before they are ready. How well the tools can spot mistakes, and whether their claims have been verified, must be made clear, says Michèle Nuijten, a researcher in metascience at Tilburg University in the Netherlands. “If you start pointing fingers at people and then it turns out that there was no mistake, there might be reputational damage,” she says.Others add that although there are risks and the projects need to be cautious about what they claim, the goal is the right one. It is much easier to churn out shoddy papers than it is to retract them, says James Heathers, a forensic metascientist at Linnaeus University in Växjö, Sweden. As a first step, AI could be used to triage papers for further scrutiny, says Heathers, who has acted as a consultant for the Black Spatula Project. “It’s early days, but I’m supportive” of the initiatives, he adds.Both the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError use large language models (LLMs) to spot a range of errors in papers, including ones of fact as well as in calculations, methodology and referencing.The systems first extract information, including tables and images, from the papers. They then craft a set of complex instructions, known as a prompt, which tells a ‘reasoning’ model — a specialist type of LLM — what it is looking at and what kinds of error to hunt for. The model might analyse a paper multiple times, either scanning for different types of error each time, or to cross-check results. The cost of analysing each paper ranges from 15 cents to a few dollars, depending on the length of the paper and the series of prompts used.The rate of false positives, instances in which the AI claims an error where there is none, is a major hurdle. Currently, the Black Spatula Project’s system is wrong about an error around 10% of the time, says Gulloso. Each alleged error must be checked with experts in the subject, and finding them is the project’s greatest bottleneck, says Steve Newman, the software engineer and entrepreneur who founded the Black Spatula Project.So far, Schlicht’s YesNoError team has quantified the false positives in only around 100 mathematical errors that the AI found in an initial batch of 10,000 papers. Of the 90% of authors who responded to Schlicht, all but one agreed that the error detected was valid, he says. Eventually, YesNoError is planning to work with ResearchHub, a platform which pays PhD scientists in cryptocurrency to carry out peer review. When the AI has checked a paper, YesNoError will trigger a request to verify the results, although this has not yet started.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What does “PhD-level” AI mean?

According to a report from The Information, OpenAI may be planning to launch several specialized AI "agent" products, including a $20,000 monthly tier focused on supporting "PhD-level research." Other reportedly planned agents include a "high-income knowledge worker" assistant at $2,000 monthly and a software developer agent at $10,000 monthly.OpenAI has not yet confirmed these prices, but they have mentioned PhD-level AI capabilities before. So what exactly constitutes "PhD-level AI"? The term refers to models that supposedly perform tasks requiring doctoral-level expertise. These include agents conducting advanced research, writing and debugging complex code without human intervention, and analyzing large datasets to generate comprehensive reports. The key claim is that these models can tackle problems that typically require years of specialized academic training.Companies like OpenAI base their "PhD-level" claims on performance in specific benchmark tests. For example, OpenAI's o1 series models reportedly performed well in science, coding, and math tests, with results similar to human PhD students on challenging tasks. The company's Deep Research tool, which can generate research papers with citations, scored 26.6 percent on "Humanity's Last Exam," a comprehensive evaluation covering over 3,000 questions across more than 100 subjects.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Rise and Fall of Terrorgram (trailer) | FRONTLINE</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xydLuigooY</link><author>FRONTLINE PBS | Official</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/_xydLuigooY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 7 Mar 2025 22:23:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ScyryU9Oy9Wse3a8OAmYQ">FRONTLINE PBS | Official</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[FRONTLINE and ProPublica investigate how an online network known as Terrorgram spread extremism and violence.

The links led targeted machines through several intermediary sites until finally arriving at repositories on Microsoft-owned GitHub, which hosted a raft of malicious files.The malware was loaded in four stages, each of which acted as a building block for the next.

Could Afghanistan become a more just country? A group of Afghan women sat at the negotiating table. But after the Taliban took power in 2021, those dreams were dashed.

Four women were part of an Afghan negotiating team that included representatives of the former government. They wrestled with the Taliban over the future of Afghanistan. Although it was life-threatening for them to raise their voices against the Taliban's misogynistic regime, they never gave up hope of preserving the women of Afghanistan’s hard-won rights. 

The team's intelligence, perseverance and bravery in the face of a hopeless situation are characteristic, when it comes to women around the world who fight for both peace and equality. But the Taliban were not interested in a democratic, free society in which girls and women have basic rights and can go to school, study or work. After decades of war and chaos, Afghanistan has become safer under the Taliban. But the price for women is high: they have paid with their freedom.

Is God, if there is a God, a personal, conscious, all-powerful Supreme Being? Some offer radically different concepts of ‘God’, exploring novel ideas of what God may be like. They challenge theism—the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam—with radically new kinds of gods. Is this ‘heresy’? Or enlarging our vision of what the Ultimate can be like?

ABSTRACT
Several of the leading Continuous Delivery tool vendors have been under attack, including CircleCI, TeamCity and most recently Jenkins. These Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery tools are an important part of the supply chain, and supply chain safety. Supply chain attacks are particularly dangerous, as they may allow attackers to compromise otherwise trusted software at source.

In this episode, Dave Farley explores these recent attacks, and their consequences while describing some of the things that may help you to protect your means of production.

DESCRIPTION
Charles Humble interviews Dr. Gail Murphy about the challenges in software engineering today. They discuss how productivity isn’t just about lines of code but is more about focus and minimizing task-switching.

Gail also talks about the difficulty of managing the rapid evolution of system architectures, stressing the need for regular restructuring and refactoring to avoid issues like increased coupling and decreased performance. The conversation moves to open-source development, where Gail highlights how using open-source components can create complex, brittle dependencies, and the need for better communication within these ecosystems.

They wrap up by discussing the evolving role of technical leadership in navigating these challenges. [...]

when SSHed into a remote machine?? It’s an escape code called OSC 52!)They aren’t completely standardized, and because of that they don’t always
work reliably. And because they’re also invisible, it’s extremely
frustrating to troubleshoot escape code issues.So I wanted to put together a list for myself of some standards that exist
around escape codes, because I want to know if they  to feel unreliable
and frustrating, or if there’s a future where we could all rely on them with
more confidence.Have you ever pressed the left arrow key in your terminal and seen ?
That’s an escape code! It’s called an “escape code” because the first character
is the “escape” character, which is usually written as , , ,
, or .Escape codes are how your terminal emulator communicates various kinds of
information (colours, mouse movement, etc) with programs running in the
terminal. There are two kind of escape codes: which your terminal emulator sends for keypresses or mouse
movements that don’t fit into Unicode. For example “left arrow key” is
, “Ctrl+left arrow” might be , and clicking the mouse might
be something like . which programs can print out to colour text, move the
cursor around, clear the screen, hide the cursor, copy text to the
clipboard, enable mouse reporting, set the window title, etc.Now let’s talk about standards!The first standard I found relating to escape codes was
ECMA-48,
which was originally published in 1976.Define some general  for escape codes (like “CSI” codes, which are
 + something and “OSC” codes, which are  + something)Define some specific escape codes, like how “move the cursor to the left” is
, or “turn text red” is  . In the spec, the “cursor left”
one is called  and the one for changing colours is called
.The formats are extensible, so there’s room for others to define more escape
codes in the future. Lots of escape codes that are popular today aren’t defined
in ECMA-48: for example it’s pretty common for terminal applications (like vim,
htop, or tmux) to support using the mouse, but ECMA-48 doesn’t define escape
codes for the mouse.There are a bunch of escape codes that aren’t defined in ECMA-48, for example:enabling mouse reporting (where did you click in your terminal?)bracketed paste (did you paste that text or type it in?)OSC 52 (which terminal applications can use to copy text to your system clipboard)I believe (correct me if I’m wrong!) that these and some others came from
xterm, are documented in XTerm Control Sequences, and have
been widely implemented by other terminal emulators.This list of “what xterm supports” is not a standard exactly, but xterm is
extremely influential and so it seems like an important document.In the 80s (and to some extent today, but my understanding is that it was MUCH
more dramatic in the 80s) there was a huge amount of variation in what escape
codes terminals actually supported.To deal with this, there’s a database of escape codes for various terminals
called “terminfo”.It looks like the standard for terminfo is called X/Open Curses, though you need to create
an account to view that standard for some reason. It defines the database format as well
as a C library interface (“curses”) for accessing the database.For example you can run this bash snippet to see every possible escape code for
“clear screen” for all of the different terminals your system knows about:for term in $(toe -a | awk '{print $1}')
do
  echo $term
  infocmp -1 -T "$term" 2>/dev/null | grep 'clear=' | sed 's/clear=//g;s/,//g'
done
On my system (and probably every system I’ve ever used?), the terminfo database is managed by ncurses.should programs use terminfo?I think it’s interesting that there are two main approaches that applications
take to handling ANSI escape codes:Use the terminfo database to figure out which escape codes to use, depending
on what’s in the  environment variable. Fish does this, for example.Identify a “single common set” of escape codes which works in “enough”
terminal emulators and just hardcode those.Some examples of programs/libraries that take approach #2 (“don’t use terminfo”) include:[the terminfo authors] have done a lot of work that, at the time, was
extremely important and helpful. My point is that it no longer is.I’m not going to do it justice so I’m not going to summarize it, I think it’s
worth reading.I was just talking about the idea that you can use a “common set” of escape
codes that will work for most people. But what is that set? Is there any agreement?I really do not know the answer to this at all, but from doing some reading it
seems like it’s some combination of:The codes that the VT100 supported (though some aren’t relevant on modern terminals)what’s in ECMA-48 (which I think also has some things that are no longer relevant)What xterm supports (though I’d guess that not everything in there is actually widely supported enough)and maybe ultimately “identify the terminal emulators you think your users are
going to use most frequently and test in those”, the same way web developers do
when deciding which CSS features are okay to useI don’t think there are any resources like Can I use…? or
Baseline for the terminal
though. (in theory terminfo is supposed to be the “caniuse” for the terminal
but it seems like it often takes 10+ years to add new terminal features when
people invent them which makes it very limited)some reasons to use terminfoI also asked on Mastodon why people found terminfo valuable in 2025 and got a
few reasons that made sense to me:some people expect to be able to use the  environment variable to
control how programs behave (for example with ), and there’s
no standard for how that should work in a post-terminfo worldeven though there’s  variation between terminal emulators than
there was in the 80s, there’s far from zero variation: there are graphical
terminals, the Linux framebuffer console, the situation you’re in when
connecting to a server via its serial console, Emacs shell mode, and probably
more that I’m missingthere is no one standard for what the “single common set” of escape codes
is, and sometimes programs use escape codes which aren’t actually widely
supported enoughterminfo & user agent detectionThe way that ncurses uses the  environment variable to decide which
escape codes to use reminds me of how webservers used to sometimes use the
browser user agent to decide which version of a website to serve.It also seems like it’s had some of the same results – the way iTerm2 reports
itself as being “xterm-256color” feels similar to how Safari’s user agent is
“Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 14_7_4) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML,
like Gecko) Version/18.3 Safari/605.1.15”. In both cases the terminal emulator
/ browser ends up changing its user agent to get around user agent detection
that isn’t working well.On the web we ended up deciding that user agent detection was not a good
practice and to instead focus on standardization so we can serve the same
HTML/CSS to all browsers. I don’t know if the same approach is the future in
the terminal though – I think the terminal landscape today is much more
fragmented than the web ever was as well as being much less well funded.some more documents/standardsA few more documents and standards related to escape codes, in no particular order:why I think this is interestingI sometimes see people saying that the unix terminal is “outdated”, and since I
love the terminal so much I’m always curious about what incremental changes
might make it feel less “outdated”.Maybe if we had a clearer standards landscape (like we do on the web!) it would
be easier for terminal emulator developers to build new features and for
authors of terminal applications to more confidently adopt those features so
that we can all benefit from them and have a richer experience in the terminal.Obviously standardizing ANSI escape codes is not easy (ECMA-48 was first
published almost 50 years ago and we’re still not there!). I don’t even know
what all of the challenges are. But the situation with HTML/CSS/JS used to be
extremely bad too and now it’s MUCH better, so maybe there’s hope.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata</title><link>https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn</link><author>eyvindn</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:43:37 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CMU research shows compression alone may unlock AI puzzle-solving abilities</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/compression_illustration_2-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 23:22:05 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A pair of Carnegie Mellon University researchers recently discovered hints that the process of compressing information can solve complex reasoning tasks without pre-training on a large number of examples.

(There's a previous front page Show HN about Pipecat, the open source voice AI orchestration framework I work on. [1])It's been almost two years, and for most of that time, I've been expecting that someone would "solve" turn detection. We all built initial, pretty good 80/20 versions of turn detection on top of VAD (voice activity detection) models. And then, as an ecosystem, we kind of got stuck.A few production applications have recently started using Gemini 2.0 Flash to do context aware turn detection. [2] But because latency is ~500ms, that's a more complicated approach than using a specialized model. The team at LiveKit released an open weights model that does text-based turn detection. [3] I was really excited to see that, but I'm not super-optimistic that a text-input model will ever be good enough for this task. (A good rule of thumb in deep learning is that you should bet on end-to-end.)So ... I spent Christmas break training several little proof of concept models, and experimenting with generating synthetic audio data. So, so, so much fun. The results were promising enough that I nerd-sniped a few friends and we started working in earnest on this.The model now performs really well on a subset of turn detection tasks. Too well, really. We're overfitting on a not-terribly-broad initial data set of about 8,000 samples. Getting to this point was the initial bar we set for doing a public release and seeing if other people want to get involved in the project.There are lots of ways to contribute. [4]Medium-term goals for the project are:  - Support for a wide range of languages
  - Inference time of <50ms on GPU and <500ms on CPU
  - Much wider range of speech nuances captured in training data
  - A completely synthetic training data pipeline. (Maybe?)
  - Text conditioning of the model, to support "modes" like credit card, telephone number, and address entry.

If you're interested in voice AI or in audio model ML engineering, please try the model out and see what you think. I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Godspeed, Soldier</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZOk4XXGQY8</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/6ZOk4XXGQY8?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 18:20:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2285 - Andrew Schulz</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihfM3qgWz6I</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ihfM3qgWz6I?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 18:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Schulz is a stand-up comic, actor, and podcaster.

myself reading a bunch of computer science papers. I don't pretend to be good
at this - but I don't mind some confusion or being overwhelmed, and I'm okay to
admit my ignorance. . I ran into this 15 year old paper 
that introduced several concepts entirely new to me. I struggled to understand
them.So what do you do then? You look for more papers to help explain things. This
is a risky endeavor, because they might confuse you even more, but it cannot be
avoided. I discovered a paper for a relevant data structure that mentioned
source code on a website. The source code was in C++ and I am working in Rust,
but I figured I'd take a look anyway. But when I went to the website the
resource wasn't there. So I mailed the owner of the website, who happened to be
a computer science professor.This professor (Gonzalo Navarro) was
very friendly and immediately mailed me back . Only during
our conversation did I realize I was seeing his name on a  of papers in
the field. Turned out I had stumbled into talking to one of the world experts in
the field of succinct data strucures, within a few days of my discovery they
even existed. Ignorance can bring you far.So what are succinct data structures? If you've taken computer science courses
in recent decades you might have, but I didn't run into them before as a
programmer, or if I did, I immediately forgot. But now I think they're data
structures with fascinating properties.We all use arrays, and hashmaps, and various trees are common too. We don't have to fully
understand how they work in order to be able to leverage their properties
effectively. Now I found msyelf wondering why people don't use these succinct
data structures more often.So I figured I'd talk a bit about them.To introduce succinct data structures it's useful to compare them to
compression. You use compression to shrink the size required to represent this
data. Compression can be useful to save disk space, or transmit less data over
the network, or to save memory. But to do anything useful with compressed data,
such as access it or query it, you first need to uncompress it again. Then
afterwards if you want to save space, you need to compress it again.Succinct data structures are different: they store their content in a compact
fashion like compression, but the compact form of the data has useful
properties. You can still use it!This is a field that seems to have emerged in computer science relatively
recently; many of the important data structures were invented in the last 25
years.In this article I going to give a tour of some of the succinct data structures
I have run into. I do not claim any expertise in this area at all - I only have
the vaguest notion of how many of these data structures work. Heck, I only
discovered they existed a few months ago! But as I said, you don't need to know
how they work in order to use them.In systems programming one cares more about the particular characteristics
(memory, performance) of data structures than usual. It strikes me there are
quite a few potential applications for them in this field. Much of the original
research work with compact data structures was done with C++. I myself like to
use Rust for my systems programming, so I looked for implementations in Rust.
I'm going to share what I found in the hopes other developers who use Rust find
them interesting. But the general overview is not limited to Rust in any way,
so if you're not interested in Rust I invite you to read on as well.Consider a vector (array) of bits. For instance What I'm going to say is pretty
obvious, but I think it's useful to highlight anyway. The bit vector above is 8
entries long. This means it fits into a single byte of memory.On a 64 bit computer, 64 bits fit in a single native integer. That's a bit
vector of 64 entries fitting inside 8 bytes, which is quite a lot if you
consider that a normal array takes that many bytes for a  integer
value. Even a bool in Rust takes a byte of storage.Bit vectors themselves aren't succinct data structures. In the end computer
memory is a giant array of bits. But succinct data structures try to make every
bit count.It's also important to note that a data structure might present itself as a bit
vector but actually stores the information inside in some special way that
makes certain operations fast. That's what we're going to see next.The rank/select bit vector is a core succinct data structure that many others
are built on. When I was hunting for source code I had only just realized that
these weren't just plain bit vectors but supported special operations, 
and .Let's look at our bit vector from before: .We give each entry an index (from 0 to 8, not inclusive).The  operation, given an index, counts how many bits have been set before
it in the array:So,  is 0 as no bits have been set at this position yet,  is
1,  is 1 as well (there's a 0 in that location, so no more bits have
been set).  is 2.  is 4.The  operation is the inverse of rank. You can give it a rank and get
the index where that bit was set.So  is 1,  is 3,  is 4, and  is 6.
Just the subsequent indexes where you see a .A succinct implementation of a rank/select bit vector can do these operations
in constant time. Only a little bit more data than is taken up by the bit
vector itself is required to support these operations.So what are the use cases for this? Let's consider a simple one.Let's say you have a big string that is actually composed of lots of little
strings. You want to track where all of these strings start. Now there are many
data structures you could use for this, and often they might be better, but
let's use a rank/select bit vector.Here's string with positions under it:Note the special  markers. These could be encoded as  in practice.So, this big string has 4 substrings, which we can view as an array:We can identify each substring with a number that is the index to this array:Now let's consider a rank/select bit vector. For the points in this string
where the substring starts, at each location you have an , you set a bit in
it.Now when you have any position in this you can efficiently determine which
sub-string it belongs to using  - you get a substring identifier. For
instance, position 12 is in "I am a string" and  gets me .If you add 1 to an identifier you get the next substring identifier - a useful
property.You can turn the substring identifier back into a position using . For
instance  gets you , the position of the first  in the string,
i.e the start of . Add 1 to that and you have the start of the
next substring. So if you want to find the end of a string, you can add 1 to
the substring identifier and do a select on that.This allows you to maintain unique identifiers for slices in a block of data in
a compact way.With a normal rank/select bit vector you'd use 1 bit times the length of the
string as overhead, plus a little. For a string a megabyte long, that's 128
kilobytes extra, and some change. But if the set bits are relatively uncommon
you can use a  rank/select bit vector to store this additional
information very efficiently, in far less space than would be required for the
original bit vector.In Rust I've really enjoyed working with
 which has both excellent
performance and very minimal overhead over the original bit vector. The author
is very responsive and is working a range of exciting new features.Another worthwhile library is . Of
particular interest is its implementation of , which is a sparse
implementation.  in my opinion however has a better design for efficient
construction of these data structures than  does. I'm therefore glad to
report that  is in the process of adding a sparse implementation as well.A  sounds like something out of science fiction. "Doc, the
wavelet matrix is out of sync! We cannot get back to 1985!". Related other
structures are , including the  which also
has a pretty cool scifi name.What these data structures do is generalize rank/select over "arbitrary
alphabets". The alphabet of a bit vector consists of 0 and 1, but many
real-world data has a bigger alphabet. Of particular interest in the succinct
data structure space is DNA, which has the alphabet of its nucleotides "G",
"C", "A" and "T", size 4. Another very common alphabet is text. If you use
UTF-8 and store its bytes its alphabet is of size 256. Generally the smaller the alphabet, the better: the data structures need less
space and can be faster.So let's consider the string "banana" in some text alphabet like ASCII.We can now rank and select particular symbols in the alphabet. Let's consider
the letter (symbol) : is 0, as there are no s yet at index 0. But 
gets you rank 3. Similarly  lets you find the index of a symbol in the
string:  gets you index 3, the index of the second .The implementation of a wavelet matrix uses rank/select bit vectors underneath.In Rust the  crate also has an
implementation of the wavelet matrix data structure.An FM-index is data structure that lets you store text (any vector of symbols)
in a compact way, but still allows important query operations. It doesn't use
much more space than the original text (or in some cases, less).The important queries here are: which counts how many occurrences of a certain pattern
(substring) exist in the stored text. which gives the index for each occurrence of the pattern in
the original textThe ability to load up a huge string of DNA data into memory and then being
able to find substrings in it fast is extremely useful in bioinformatics. But
any use where you have a lot text against which you want to support search
operations could potentially benefit from an FM-Index.In Rust the  crate provides this
functionality.Originally the  crate used the
 crate (by the same author) for its
underlying rank/select bit vector. But I've recently ported  over to
use  instead, which boosted the performance of  considerably.I've been working with the wonderful author of  to improve its API
and functionality, and a lot more is coming in this space, including support
for storing and searching large strings consisting of multiple substrings.Let's consider a tree of data, where each node can have arbitrary amounts of
children. These are very common structures in programming. Both XML and JSON
can be represented by trees like this; so can programming language ASTs.If you want to allow arbitrary navigation within the tree, you need the
following operations on nodes in the trees:: gives the node that this node is a child of: gives the first child node of a node: gives the next sibling of a node (within its parent): gives the previous sibling of a node (within its
parent)And often this is how these trees are represented in memory. Along these lines:This is quite a bit of information per node: on a 64 bit operating system this
node clocks in at 32 bytes, or 256 bits. A balanced parentheses tree allows the
same operations but takes only 2 bits per node! Well, there's a little overhead
too used by the rank/select bit vector underneath, and a bit more in a
management data structure, but it's still impressively tiny.How does it do this? In a very brief sketch, it basically encodes a tree as a
series of parentheses. Let's consider a single tree with a root node  and
two child node  and :This can be represented as "(()())".The outer parentheses encode the root node  and the two inner  pairs
encode its child nodes. Since we have only an opening parenthesis  and a
closing parenthesis , this information can be stored in a rank/select bit
vector, with 1 for open and 0 for close.And thanks to various clever operations using  and  and a bit
of supplementary information it can support all of the navigation I mentioned
above, and quite a few operations more.The amazing author of  is working on a Rust implementation on the
 branch of the  crate. I've been using it a lot in my own work
and it's looking great!
Building on these structuresYou can use these and other succinct data structures to build new functionality
with very interesting properties.I'm working on XML processing in Rust , and the paper I mentioned in
the beginning described a way to store XML data using succinct data structures.It use a balanced parenthesis tree to store the XML tree. This does not allow
one to attach information to nodes such as the XML tag information (i.e. the
 in  and ). But you can attach information to each node by
maintaining a sparse rank/select bit vector for each tag that marks the
relevant parenthesis with additional information.This rank/select bit vector then allows fundamental new operations: you can
"jump" to the first descendant node with a particular tag without having to
traverse the intervening nodes!XML also contains text nodes. These can be attached to the tree by tracking
which opening parenthesis have the text node tag. The paper also uses an
 to store the text nodes and allow fast queries over them.While XML is perhaps a rather quaint application for these techniques, imagine
a programming language that stores its AST in such a way. Huge ASTs could be
stored relatively compactly but still support interesting search operations,
which might open up new ways to implement programming language compilers.Now that I've discovered these data structures I'm left wondering where they
were in all my programming life. I suspect there's a lot of untapped potential
in them for general computing. While data structures that use a lot more memory
can generally do many of these operations more efficiently, the ability to use
less memory has performance implications all of its own. And until last
December I had no idea they even existed! I'm sure there are a lot of
developers out there that could find interesting uses for them.The experiences I've had recently with professors, as well as the open
source developers in the Rust succinct space, give me some badly needed new
faith in humanity.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mistral OCR</title><link>https://mistral.ai/fr/news/mistral-ocr</link><author>littlemerman</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:39:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Throughout history, advancements in information abstraction and retrieval have driven human progress. From hieroglyphs to papyri, the printing press to digitization, each leap has made human knowledge more accessible and actionable, fueling further innovation. Today, we’re at the precipice of the next big leap—to unlock the collective intelligence of all digitized information. Approximately 90% of the world’s organizational data is stored as documents, and to harness this potential, we are introducing Mistral OCR. Mistral OCR is an Optical Character Recognition API that sets a new standard in document understanding. Unlike other models, Mistral OCR comprehends each element of documents—media, text, tables, equations—with unprecedented accuracy and cognition. It takes images and PDFs as input and extracts content in an ordered interleaved text and images.As a result, Mistral OCR is an ideal model to use in combination with a RAG system taking multimodal documents (such as slides or complex PDFs) as input.We have made Mistral OCR as the default model for document understanding across millions of users on Le Chat, and are releasing the API  at 1000 pages / $ (and approximately double the pages per dollar with batch inference). The API is available today on our developer suite la Plateforme, and coming soon to our cloud and inference partners, as well as on-premises.State of the art understanding of complex documentsNatively multilingual and multimodalDoc-as-prompt, structured outputSelectively available to self-host for organizations dealing with highly sensitive or classified informationState of the art understanding of complex documentsMistral OCR excels in understanding complex document elements, including interleaved imagery, mathematical expressions, tables, and advanced layouts such as LaTeX formatting. The model enables deeper understanding of rich documents such as scientific papers with charts, graphs, equations and figures. Below is an example of the model extracting text as well as imagery from a given PDF into a markdown file. You can access the notebook here. Below we have side-by-side comparisons of PDFs and their respective OCR's outputs. Hover the slider  to switch between input and output. Mistral OCR has consistently outperformed other leading OCR models in rigorous benchmark tests. Its superior accuracy across multiple aspects of document analysis is illustrated below. We extract embedded images from documents along with text. The other LLMs compared below, do not have that capability. For a fair comparison, we evaluate them on our internal “text-only” test-set containing various publication papers, and PDFs from the web; below:Since Mistral’s founding, we have aspired to serve the world with our models, and consequently strived for multilingual capabilities across our offerings. Mistral OCR takes this to a new level, being able to parse, understand, and transcribe thousands of scripts, fonts, and languages across all continents. This versatility is crucial for both global organizations that handle documents from diverse linguistic backgrounds, as well as hyperlocal businesses serving niche markets.Fuzzy Match in GenerationBeing lighter weight than most models in the category, Mistral OCR performs significantly faster than its peers, processing up to 2000 pages per minute on a single node. The ability to rapidly process documents ensures continuous learning and improvement even for high-throughput environments.Doc-as-prompt, structured outputMistral OCR also introduces the use of documents as prompts, enabling more powerful and precise instructions. This capability allows users to extract specific information from documents and format it in structured outputs, such as JSON. Users can chain extracted outputs into downstream function calls and build agents.Available to self-host on a selective basisFor organizations with stringent data privacy requirements, Mistral OCR offers a self-hosting option. This ensures that sensitive or classified information remains secure within your own infrastructure, providing compliance with regulatory and security standards. If you would like to explore self-deployment with us, please let us know.We are empowering our beta customers to elevate their organizational knowledge by transforming their extensive document repositories into actions and solutions. Some of the key use cases where our technology is making a significant impact include:Digitizing scientific research: Leading research institutions have been experimenting with Mistral OCR to convert scientific papers and journals into AI-ready formats, making them accessible to downstream intelligence engines. This has facilitated measurably faster collaboration and accelerated scientific workflows.Preserving historical and cultural heritage: Organizations and nonprofits that are custodians of heritage have been using Mistral OCR to digitize historical documents and artifacts, ensuring their preservation and making them accessible to a broader audience.Streamlining customer service: Customer service departments are exploring Mistral OCR to transform documentation and manuals into indexed knowledge, reducing response times and improving customer satisfaction.Making literature across design, education, legal, etc. AI ready: Mistral OCR has also been helping companies convert technical literature, engineering drawings, lecture notes, presentations, regulatory filings and much more into indexed, answer-ready formats, unlocking intelligence and productivity across millions of documents.Mistral OCR capabilities are free to try on le Chat. To try the API, head over to la Plateforme. We’d love to get your feedback; expect the model to continue to get even better in the weeks to come. As part of our strategic engagement programs, we will also offer on-premises deployment on a selective basis.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>TikTok just released its React Native killer…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qjE8JkIVoQ</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-qjE8JkIVoQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 6 Mar 2025 17:24:22 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using code FIRESHIP to get get 1-month free https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

For many, a name bound up with scandals, cover-ups and human rights violations. Headlines like these long tarnished the EU’s border protection agency’s reputation. But now, it’s trying to wipe the slate clean with a new boss, a new image and greater transparency.

The message now? That scandals are a thing of a past. The documentary asks: Is this true? A team of journalists films at the Frontex headquarters in Warsaw, as officials discover boats with migrants in the Mediterranean. How is the agency dealing with these? 

The new head of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, explains the new strategy, while former employees report on past failures. The film also follows former Frontex chief Fabrice Leggeri during the election campaign in France. He’s said to be responsible for many of the scandals - and now sits in the EU Parliament for the far right. The documentary also investigates claims of recent illegal pushbacks.

In 2011 an anonymous poster on the now infamously controversial image board 4chan posed a mathematical puzzle about the cult classic anime series The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Though the bulletin board has become littered with hateful, violent and extreme content, that original post led to a solution to the sophisticated math problem.The first season of this anime series consists of 14 episodes that were designed so that you can watch them in any order you like. (For people who are as unfamiliar with the anime world as I am: an eight-part live-action thriller called  on Netflix follows the same principle.) At some point in a 2011 discussion of the series on 4chan, someone asked the minimum number of episodes they would have to watch to have seen it in every possible order.In fact, this question is related to so-called superpermutations. And as it turns out, this mathematical area holds many puzzles: to this day, mathematicians are still unable to fully answer the problem that the 4chan user had posed.On supporting science journalismIf you're enjoying this article, consider supporting our award-winning journalism bysubscribing. By purchasing a subscription you are helping to ensure the future of impactful stories about the discoveries and ideas shaping our world today.But amazingly, in that discussion, one of the anonymous users made an estimate of the minimum amount of all episodes to watch with an approach that was previously unknown to mathematicians. “I’ll need to [elaborate on] this in multiple posts. Please look it over for any loopholes I might have missed,” wrote the user, who explained in several steps how they arrived at their estimate. Other users then took up the arguments and discussed them—but outside of 4chan, none of this made any waves. No one seemed to take any notice.In mathematics, two objects permutate when they are rearranged or recombined. For example, you can permutate AB to BA. If an anime series consisted of only two parts, you could either watch the first and then the second episode (1-2) or the second and then the first (2-1).If you want to watch a series in multiple arrangements—perhaps to figure out which sequence of episodes makes the most sense—you need a superpermutation. This is a sequence of all possible permutations. Imagine a marathon showing where you watch the first episode, followed by the second, and then watch the second episode, followed by the first (1-2-2-1). To avoid watching the second episode twice in a row, a shorter superpermutation would be 1-2-1; you would only have to watch three episodes to still have every possible order covered.If a series consists of three episodes, it becomes a little trickier to find the shortest superpermutation. In this case, there are 3! = 6 different sequences: 1-2-3, 1-3-2, 2-3-1, 2-1-3, 3-1-2, 3-2-1. Fortunately, you don’t have to watch 3 × 6 = 18 parts but can find a clever shortcut, in this case: 1-2-3-1-2-1-3-2-1. That order contains all possible permutations of the numbers 1, 2 and 3, but you only have to watch nine episodes!Mathematicians have also calculated the shortest superpermutations for a series consisting of  = 4 and  = 5 episodes (33 and 153 episodes, respectively). Beyond that, however, they are in the dark. The shortest superpermutations for  > 5 are not known.In fact, the challenge relates to one of the most intractable problems in algorithmics: the traveling salesperson problem. In this problem, a person wants to visit different cities and end up back in their hometown. The task is to find the shortest route that connects all the cities. The shortest superpermutation is a variation of this problem in which the individual permutations represent different cities. In this case, you assign different distances between cities by determining the overlap of the permutations. For example, cities 1-2-3 and 2-3-1 have a large overlap: the last two digits of the first permutation match the first two digits of the second, so they can be combined to form 1-2-3-1. We can therefore assign a short distance between those two cities. On the other hand, 1-2-3 and 2-1-3 do not overlap. (To see both sequences, you have to look at a full six parts; no shortcut is possible.) Thus, these cities have a large distance between them.To find the shortest route within permutations, you connect the permutations that overlap the most. There is only one difficulty: there is no known algorithm that solves the traveling salesperson problem quickly. If we are dealing with a few cities—or, in the case of an anime series, a few episodes—this is not a major drawback. But as soon as the  becomes large, computers fail at the task because the computing time grows exponentially with .Computers are able to calculate superpermutations for  = 4 and  = 5 but not for anything beyond that. And although it is possible to calculate elaborate superpermutations for larger numbers, finding the shortest superpermutation becomes more difficult.Experts must therefore make do with estimates. For example, there is an algorithm that helps estimate the length of the shortest possible superpermutation for  objects: 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + ! Using that algorithm, if  = 2, you get a superpermutation of length 1 + 2 = 3. For  = 3, this results in a length of 1 + 2 + 6 = 9. For  = 4, you get 33. And for  = 5, you get 153, which corresponds to the shortest superpermutation in each case.For larger  however, this algorithm no longer applies: computers have been able to find shorter superpermutations than it would suggest exists. In fact, the formula 1! + 2! + 3! + ... + ! massively overestimates the length of the shortest superpermutation for large . Although the algorithm offers only an approximate answer, mathematicians use it as a starting place, with the goal of narrowing down options to find more precise answers.Coincidences and RediscoveriesIn 2013 Nathaniel Johnston, now a mathematics professor at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, landed on a Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya fandom page. Johnston himself was not an anime fan. He had arrived at the site after Googling some search terms related to superpermutations. There he came across the discussion that had been held on 4chan almost two years earlier, which a user had copied to the fandom site.Then in October 2018 mathematician Robin Houston came across his colleague’s blog post through a curious coincidence. Houston had just learned that Australian science fiction author Greg Egan had found a new length for the shortest superpermutations, expressed as:! +( –1)! + ( – 2)! + ( – 3)! + – 3That in itself was bizarre. But when Houston started learning more about this result, he realized that the minimum length of a superpermutation had been given a new value by an anonymous anime fandom user (he didn’t know about the origins on 4chan at that time). The formula for the minimum length is:! +( – 1)! + ( – 2)! +  – 3Houston shared his discovery on Twitter (now X) on October 23 of that year. “A curious situation. The best known lower bound for the minimal length of superpermutations was proven by an anonymous user of a wiki mainly devoted to anime,” he wrote.Along with his colleagues, mathematicians Jay Pantone and Vince Vatter, Houston decided to check the 4chan user’s proof and write it down in a mathematical way. The researchers posted their mathematical work to the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences that same month, and the first author is listed as “Anonymous 4chan Poster.”So what do these formulas tell us? If you want to watch all episodes of an -part series in all possible combinations, you must sit through at least ! +(– 1)! + ( – 2)! +  – 3 episodes—that’s the 4chan user’s contribution—and at most ! +( – 1)! + ( – 2)! + ( – 3)! +  – 3, which we know through Egan’s work.In the case of the eight-episode series  you would have to watch at least 46,085 and, at most, 46,205 episodes. For The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, or  with 14 episodes, the number increases drastically: a minimum of 93,884,313,611 episodes and a maximum of 93,924,230,411. Recall that this is not a complete solution—it’s just setting a range for the size of a superpermutation that would allow you to efficiently watch the series in every possible order.Fortunately, Egan also provided an algorithm for constructing the corresponding superpermutation. This allows  fans to work out the best viewing order of episodes. But with an average episode length of around 24 minutes, it would take about 4 million years to sit through this superpermutation.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>You might be surprised by what you&apos;d find in your pores - M.

--

Two species of Demodex mites specifically inhabit human follicles. And not just some people’s— nearly everyone is thought to host mites. One person’s face might harbor hundreds or even thousands of individual mites. On any given day, these microscopic arachnids are probably eating, mating, and laying eggs inside your pores. So, is this… okay? M. Alejandra Perotti investigates.

Idealism is the theory that all reality is consciousness and only consciousness, and that what we perceive to be the physical world is either a manifestation of consciousness or derived from it. Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

That’s not new.

Support our work. Become a Vox Member today: http://www.vox.com/memberships

On the first day of Donald Trump’s second presidential term, he signed an executive order about an old American rule: that with very few exceptions, anyone born here is a citizen. Trump’s order stated that the rule, which comes from the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, should no longer apply to the children of those in the United States illegally or temporarily. Within a few weeks that order had been blocked by multiple federal judges — but it was a temporary resolution, with the ultimate outcome yet to be determined, probably by the Supreme Court.

The US is far from the only country in the world that offers unconditional birthright citizenship. While it’s uncommon in Europe, Asia, and Africa, it’s very common among Western Hemisphere countries, partly because of their history as colonies populated mostly by settlers. But of the many countries with birthright citizenship in the world, the US is by far the largest, with hundreds of thousands of baby citizens born here every year to noncitizen parents. Those numbers naturally raise the question: Is this what birthright citizenship was meant for? And why do we have birthright citizenship in the first place?

The short answer is that birthright citizenship in the US came about as a way of granting citizenship after the American Civil War to the large population of formerly enslaved Black people. But that raises a different question: How did a law intended for Black Americans end up creating hundreds of thousands of new US citizens born to immigrant parents every year? In this video we trace that history, answer that question, and look at a few of the times that the US has actually had this argument before. Today’s concerns over birthright citizenship may feel specific to our particular immigration debate. They’re actually not.

DESCRIPTION
Large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models such as ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion have unprecedented potential. Because they have been trained on all the public text and images on the internet, they can make useful contributions to a wide variety of tasks. And with the barrier to entry greatly reduced today, practically any developer can harness LLMs and diffusion models to tackle problems previously unsuitable for automation.

With this book, you'll gain a solid foundation in generative AI, including how to apply these models in practice. When first integrating LLMs and diffusion models into their workflows, most developers struggle to coax reliable enough results from them to use in automated systems. Authors James Phoenix and Mike Taylor show you how a set of principles called prompt engineering can enable you to work effectively with AI.

Learn how to empower AI to work for you. This book explains:
• The structure of the interaction chain of your program's AI model and the fine-grained steps in between
• How AI model requests arise from transforming the application problem into a document completion problem in the model training domain
• The influence of LLM and diffusion model architecture—and how to best interact with it
• How these principles apply in practice in the domains of natural language processing, text and image generation, and code

      Michael Knyszek
      6 March 2025
      In last year’s blog post about the  package, we alluded
to some new features then in proposal review, and we’re excited to share that as
of Go 1.24 they are now available to all Go developers.
These new features are the 
function, which queues up a function to
run when an object is no longer reachable, and the 
type, which safely points to an object without
preventing it from being garbage collected.
Together, these two features are powerful enough to build your own 
package!
Let’s dig into what makes these features useful, and when to use them.Note: these new features are advanced features of the garbage collector.
If you’re not already familiar with basic garbage collection concepts, we
strongly recommend reading the introduction of our garbage collector
guide.If you’ve ever used a finalizer, then the concept of a cleanup will be
familiar.
A finalizer is a function, associated with an allocated object by calling
, that is later
called by the garbage collector some time after the object becomes unreachable.
At a high level, cleanups work the same way.Let’s consider an application that makes use of a memory-mapped file, and see
how cleanups can help.//go:build unix

type MemoryMappedFile struct {
    data []byte
}

func NewMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    f, err := os.Open(filename)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    defer f.Close()

    // Get the file's info; we need its size.
    fi, err := f.Stat()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    // Extract the file descriptor.
    conn, err := f.SyscallConn()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    var data []byte
    connErr := conn.Control(func(fd uintptr) {
        // Create a memory mapping backed by this file.
        data, err = syscall.Mmap(int(fd), 0, int(fi.Size()), syscall.PROT_READ, syscall.MAP_SHARED)
    })
    if connErr != nil {
        return nil, connErr
    }
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    mf := &MemoryMappedFile{data: data}
    cleanup := func(data []byte) {
        syscall.Munmap(data) // ignore error
    }
    runtime.AddCleanup(mf, cleanup, data)
    return mf, nil
}
A memory-mapped file has its contents mapped to memory, in this case, the
underlying data of a byte slice.
Thanks to operating-system magic, reads and writes to the byte slice directly
access the contents of the file.
With this code, we can pass around a , and when it’s
no longer referenced, the memory mapping we created will get cleaned up.Notice that  takes three arguments: the address of a
variable to attach the cleanup to, the cleanup function itself, and an argument
to the cleanup function.
A key difference between this function and  is that the
cleanup function takes a different argument than the object we’re attaching the
cleanup to.
This change fixes some problems with finalizers.It’s no secret that finalizers
are difficult to use correctly.
For example, objects to which finalizers are attached must not be involved
in any reference cycles (even a pointer to itself is too much!), otherwise the
object will never be reclaimed and the finalizer will never run, causing a
leak.
Finalizers also significantly delay reclamation of memory.
It takes at a minumum two full garbage collection cycles to reclaim the
memory for a finalized object: one to determine that it’s unreachable, and
another to determine that it’s still unreachable after the finalizer
executes.The problem is that finalizers resurrect the objects they’re attached
to.
The finalizer doesn’t run until the object is unreachable, at which point it is
considered “dead.”
But since the finalizer is called with a pointer to the object, the garbage
collector must prevent the reclamation of that object’s memory, and instead must
generate a new reference for the finalizer, making it reachable, or “live,” once
more.
That reference may even remain after the finalizer returns, for example if the
finalizer writes it to a global variable or sends it across a channel.
Object resurrection is problematic because it means the object, and everything
it points to, and everything those objects point to, and so on, is reachable,
even if it would otherwise have been collected as garbage.We solve both of these problems by not passing the original object to the
cleanup function.
First, the values the object refers to don’t need to be kept specially
reachable by the garbage collector, so the object can still be reclaimed even
if it’s involved in a cycle.
Second, since the object is not needed for the cleanup, its memory can be
reclaimed immediately.Returning to our memory-mapped file example, suppose we notice that our program
frequently maps the same files over and over, from different goroutines that are
unaware of each other.
This is fine from a memory perspective, since all these mappings will share
physical memory, but it results in lots of unnecessary system calls to map and
unmap the file.
This is especially bad if each goroutine reads only a small section of each
file.So, let’s deduplicate the mappings by filename.
(Let’s assume that our program only reads from the mappings, and the files
themselves are never modified or renamed once created.
Such assumptions are reasonable for system font files, for example.)We could maintain a map from filename to memory mapping, but then it becomes
unclear when it’s safe to remove entries from that map.
We could  use a cleanup, if it weren’t for the fact that the map entry
itself will keep the memory-mapped file object alive.Weak pointers solve this problem.
A weak pointer is a special kind of pointer that the garbage collector ignores
when deciding whether an object is reachable.
Go 1.24’s new weak pointer type,
, has a  method that
returns either a real pointer if the object is still reachable, or  if it
is not.If we instead maintain a map that only  points to the memory-mapped
file, we can clean up the map entry when nobody’s using it anymore!
Let’s see what this looks like.var cache sync.Map // map[string]weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]

func NewCachedMemoryMappedFile(filename string) (*MemoryMappedFile, error) {
    var newFile *MemoryMappedFile
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(filename)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newFile == nil {
                var err error
                newFile, err = NewMemoryMappedFile(filename)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newFile)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(filename, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newFile, func(filename string) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, wp)
                }, filename)
                return newFile, nil
            }
            // Someone got to installing the file before us.
            //
            // If it's still there when we check in a moment, we'll discard newFile
            // and it'll get cleaned up by garbage collector.
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[MemoryMappedFile]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(filename, value)
    }
}
This example is a little complicated, but the gist is simple.
We start with a global concurrent map of all the mapped files we made.
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile consults this map for an existing mapped
file, and if that fails, creates and tries to insert a new mapped file.
This could of course fail as well since we’re racing with other insertions, so
we need to be careful about that too, and retry.
(This design has a flaw in that we might wastefully map the same file multiple
times in a race, and we’ll have to throw it away via the cleanup added by
.
This is probably not a big deal most of the time.
Fixing it is left as an exercise for the reader.)Let’s look at some useful properties of weak pointers and cleanups exploited by
this code.Firstly, notice that weak pointers are comparable.
Not only that, weak pointers have a stable and independent identity, which
remains even after the objects they point to are long gone.
This is why it is safe for the cleanup function to call ’s
, which compares the , and a crucial reason
this code works at all.Secondly, observe that we can add multiple independent cleanups to a single
 object.
This allows us to use cleanups in a composable way and use them to build
generic data structures.
In this particular example, it might be more efficient to combine
NewCachedMemoryMappedFile with  and
have them share a cleanup.
However, the advantage of the code we wrote above is that it can be rewritten
in a generic way!type Cache[K comparable, V any] struct {
    create func(K) (*V, error)
    m     sync.Map
}

func NewCache[K comparable, V any](create func(K) (*V, error)) *Cache[K, V] {
    return &Cache[K, V]{create: create}
}

func (c *Cache[K, V]) Get(key K) (*V, error) {
    var newValue *V
    for {
        // Try to load an existing value out of the cache.
        value, ok := cache.Load(key)
        if !ok {
            // No value found. Create a new mapped file if needed.
            if newValue == nil {
                var err error
                newValue, err = c.create(key)
                if err != nil {
                    return nil, err
                }
            }

            // Try to install the new mapped file.
            wp := weak.Make(newValue)
            var loaded bool
            value, loaded = cache.LoadOrStore(key, wp)
            if !loaded {
                runtime.AddCleanup(newValue, func(key K) {
                    // Only delete if the weak pointer is equal. If it's not, someone
                    // else already deleted the entry and installed a new mapped file.
                    cache.CompareAndDelete(key, wp)
                }, key)
                return newValue, nil
            }
        }

        // See if our cache entry is valid.
        if mf := value.(weak.Pointer[V]).Value(); mf != nil {
            return mf, nil
        }

        // Discovered a nil entry awaiting cleanup. Eagerly delete it.
        cache.CompareAndDelete(key, value)
    }
}
Despite our best efforts, cleanups and weak pointers can still be error-prone.
To guide those considering using finalizers, cleanups, and weak pointers, we
recently updated the guide to the garbage
collector with some advice
about using these features.
Take a look next time you reach for them, but also carefully consider whether
you need to use them at all.
These are advanced tools with subtle semantics and, as the guide says, most
Go code benefits from these features indirectly, not from using them directly.
Stick to the use-cases where these features shine, and you’ll be alright.For now, we’ll call out some of the issues that you are more likely to run into.First, the object the cleanup is attached to must be reachable from neither
the cleanup function (as a captured variable) nor the argument to the cleanup
function.
Both of these situations result in the cleanup never executing.
(In the special case of the cleanup argument being exactly the pointer passed
to ,  will panic, as a signal to the
caller that they should not use cleanups the same way as finalizers.)Second, when weak pointers are used as map keys, the weakly referenced object
must not be reachable from the corresponding map value, otherwise the object
will continue to remain live.
This may seem obvious when deep inside of a blog post about weak pointers, but
it’s an easy subtlety to miss.
This problem inspired the entire concept of an
ephemeron to resolve it, which is a
potential future direction.Thirdly, a common pattern with cleanups is that a wrapper object is needed, like
we see here with our  example.
In this particular case, you could imagine the garbage collector directly
tracking the mapped memory region and passing around the inner .
Such functionality is possible future work, and an API for it has been recently
proposed.Lastly, both weak pointers and cleanups are inherently non-deterministic, their
behavior depending intimately on the design and dynamics of the garbage
collector.
The documentation for cleanups even permits the garbage collector never to run
cleanups at all.
Effectively testing code that uses them can be tricky, but it is
possible.Weak pointers have been brought up as a feature for Go since nearly the
beginning, but for years were not prioritized by the Go team.
One reason for that is that they are subtle, and the design space of weak
pointers is a minefield of decisions that can make them even harder to use.
Another is that weak pointers are a niche tool, while simultaneously adding
complexity to the language.
We already had experience with how painful  could be to use.
But there are some useful programs that are not expressible without them, and
the  package and the reasons for its existence really emphasized that.With generics, the hindsight of finalizers, and insights from all the great work
since done by teams in other languages like C# and Java, the designs for weak
pointers and cleanups came together quickly.
The desire to use weak pointers with finalizers raised additional questions,
and so the design for  quickly came together as well.I want to thank everyone in the community who contributed feedback on the
proposal issues and filed bugs when the features became available.
I also want to thank David Chase for thoroughly thinking through weak
pointer semantics with me, and I want to thank him, Russ Cox, and Austin
Clements for their help with the design of .
I want to thank Carlos Amedee for his work on getting 
implemented, polished, landed for Go 1.24.
And finally I want to thank Carlos Amedee and Ian Lance Taylor for their work
replacing  with  throughout the
standard library for Go 1.25.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Will the future of software development run on vibes?</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/vibe_coding_1-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 23:41:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[To many people, coding is about precision. It's about telling a computer what to do and having the computer perform those actions exactly, precisely, and repeatedly. With the rise of AI tools like ChatGPT, it's now possible for someone to describe a program in English and have the AI model translate it into working code without ever understanding how the code works. Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy recently gave this practice a name—"vibe coding"—and it's gaining traction in tech circles.The technique, enabled by large language models (LLMs) from companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, has attracted attention for potentially lowering the barrier to entry for software creation. But questions remain about whether the approach can reliably produce code suitable for real-world applications, even as tools like Cursor Composer, GitHub Copilot, and Replit Agent make the process increasingly accessible to non-programmers.Instead of being about control and precision, vibe coding is all about surrendering to the flow. On February 2, Karpathy introduced the term in a post on X, writing, "There's a new kind of coding I call 'vibe coding,' where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists." He described the process in deliberately casual terms: "I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>White Boy Summer</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpO2dFPcNEo</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/DpO2dFPcNEo?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 23:28:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Kelly J.

How can God’s perfect knowledge not eliminate free will? Since God-to-be-God can never be wrong and knows everything, including propositions about future events, how can those propositions about future events, which God knows now, not come to pass in the actual future? Hence, if we cannot do otherwise than what God knew prior, how can we have free will?

That happened when I started running a simple server from my trusty old Raspberry Pi version 1.I know its local IP address and can  into it easily when I’m home, but when I’m outside, that’s not possible as it’s not exposed to the internet. For that reason, I have used DDNS in the past. The bad news is that it’s no longer possible thanks to a cursed thing called CGNAT. I don’t want to derail this post too much, but unfortunately port forwarding is no longer a thing that you can do. (And maybe it wasn’t such a good idea to expose your home server to the internet to begin with.)This reminded me of Tailscale, and I decided to give it a go. From what I could remember, it creates a virtual private network so you can access your devices anywhere with domain shorthands created by Tailscale.Long story short, it worked! I could connect from anywhere with  command. But my old Raspberry Pi was too weak to run it, so I ended up uninstalling it, and unrelatedly my pet project grew out and has its place in the cloud now.To get started, you need to install the client software on the devices, which are mostly open-source. Then you need to log in with your account, which is an easy process. I won’t go into detail about how to install and use it, since this isn’t an ad, and such instructions can quickly go out-of-date.Some additional and surprising benefits:Exposing a port from your laptop to your phone: When developing a web application, once in a while you’ll have to test on an actual device. (You do that, right?) The kind of thing you’d reach for ngrok for. You can use the Tailscale-generated domain name (e.g. http://my-macbook-air:3000) to effortlessly connect to your development server.Taildrop: There’s been a lot of times when I needed to move files from my Macbook to my Windows HTPC, which is hard. I’d used Snapdrop, which is excellent for the limitations it has to work around, but I was always on the lookout for a click-less solution. With Taildrop, you can drop files as easily as Airdrop, even when you’re not in close proximity!Exit nodes: I clarified that Tailscale is a different kind of VPN, but I still need a VPN service from time to time, and I don’t like having two clients for a similar job. With Tailscale, you can appoint a machine to be an exit node, ideally one in a VPS in a different country, so you can get comparable benefits to a VPN service.Mullvad exit nodes: Related to the previous point, I know that VPN services allow you to exit from a large list of countries, and don’t collect logs (if you believe them). With the Mullvad partnership, Tailscale allows you to have the best of both worlds. And from what I can understand, it’s essentially a two-tier VPN, like iCloud Private Relay. Tailscale can’t see your traffic, and Mullvad doesn’t know who you are. If you’re a privacy nerd, you may find this to be a good setup.Disclaimer: I haven’t yet tried exit nodes or Mullvad integration, so your actual experience may not turn out as I described.I have used Tailscale only for personal reasons so far, using the free tier; they have enterprise plans for enterprise use cases that I have no idea about. I found it useful and wanted to share it in case it helps you too. I wasn’t paid by them, and if you don’t want to use their services for any reason, there’s an open-source server implementation called Headscale, which works with their client software.If you have more use cases, feel free to share them with me!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Apple takes UK to court over &apos;backdoor&apos; order</title><link>https://www.theregister.com/2025/03/05/apple_reportedly_ipt_complaint/</link><author>latexr</author><category>dev</category><category>hn</category><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 18:07:06 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://news.ycombinator.com/best">HN</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[ Apple has reportedly filed a legal complaint with the UK's Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) contesting the British government's order that it must forcibly break the encryption of iCloud data.The appeal will be the first of its kind lodged with the IPT, an independent judicial body that oversees legal complaints against potential unlawful actions by a public authority or UK intelligence services, according to the Financial Times, which broke the news.The revelation follows a battle between the iGadgetmaker and the UK's Home Office, which has long set its sights on Apple's encrypted cloud-hosted data, arguing it needs a backdoor in order for law enforcement to investigate persons of interest.Things came to a head in January when the Home Office issued Apple with a technical capability notice (TCN) under the Investigatory Powers Act, aka the Snooper's Charter, nearly a year after talk of such an order began.Despite being "technical" by name, it's understood that the notice didn't include any technical instructions for Apple, just an order to allow a so-called backdoor into its iCloud network which could be used to gather data that's otherwise typically out of reach of criminal investigators.The Home Office refused to either confirm or deny the existence of the notice when we asked about it, and under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016 Apple is prevented from revealing details about the notice.Apple responded by disabling its Advanced Data Protection (ADP) feature for UK users in early February, effectively removing end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for data backed up to iCloud to appease the government without fully complying with the TCN.We have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never willStill, it means British officials can feasibly sniff around iCloud accounts, provided they get a court-approved warrant to do so. With ADP disabled, various types of user account data – such as iCloud backups, photos, and notes, but not iMessages and health data – stored in Apple's cloud will not be end-to-end encrypted (E2EE), meaning the contents can be accessed and provided by Apple to investigators upon legal demand. It will also be done without alerting users, assuming someone involved in the process doesn't leak it at any stage."We are gravely disappointed that the protections provided by ADP will not be available to our customers in the UK given the continuing rise of data breaches and other threats to customer privacy," Apple told  at the time."As we have said many times before, we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will," it added.The Home Office has also previously voiced its ambition to break E2EE for all popular communications platforms in the UK, such as messaging app WhatsApp, although the case with Apple is believed to be its first foray into handing out TCNs to this end.The UK's entire approach to pressing ahead with the Investigatory Powers Act and its so-called war on encryption has come under intense scrutiny in recent years.Its main arguments in favor of breaking encryption are largely based on the prevention of terror attacks and child sexual exploitation.Security minister Dan Jarvis further justified the powers in Parliament last week, saying requests to access user data under the Act could only be made on an "exceptional basis, and only when it is necessary and proportionate to do so."Jarvis's comments came after being questioned by other MPs about the TCN, and seemingly aim to dissuade the public from thinking the government can simply access user data on a whim.The security minister didn't offer much in the way of additional insights, whipping out the good old national security defense as a way to avoid further questioning.Many who argue against the government's ambitions, such as Big Brother Watch, say the action taken against Apple is "outrageous" and "draconian" and may eventually force encrypted messaging technology underground, meaning only criminals would have access to it.US President Donald Trump also recently compared the UK's treatment of Apple to the extensive state surveillance methods deployed by China – the two countries' foremost intelligence adversary.US director of national intelligence Tulsi Gabbard has ordered a legal review of the TCN issued to Apple out of concern it could be used to gather data on US citizens. Doing so would violate the terms of the US-UK Cloud Act Agreement, she argued. has asked Apple for further comment. ®Updated to add at 1833 UTCInterestingly enough, the UK government appears to have scrubbed from the web its previous and now politically inconvenient advice to barristers, solicitors, and others in sensitive professions to use Apple's ADP at-rest end-to-end encryption. Fancy that!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2284 - Ian Carroll</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJeRWPioGbQ</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jJeRWPioGbQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 18:00:39 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ian Carroll is an independent researcher, entrepreneur, and host of "The Ian Carroll Show" on YouTube.

We're trying to strike a balance between Notion and Google Docs — very fast, ultralight and easy to share, but also supporting rich blocks and multiple pages.Weirdly, none of the many notetaking/document apps that we could find hit this combination, so we made Leaflet. With it you can:- Instantly create a doc, without an account
- Share read and edit links
- Sign-in with email to sync your docs to different devices
- Add rich blocks, like canvases, subpages, rsvps, and pollsIt's really useful for one-off collaborations, running events, or just when you need a blank page without having to buy into a whole organizational system.We also spent a lot of time making sure Leaflets look good. We've found that there's a pretty blurry boundary between a document and a website, so making something that people can feel proud to publish online was key.Here's a couple examples!Some technical details that might be interesting:- We do sync and all our client-side state via Replicache, which I really love!
- Data is modeled as a set of facts about entities, a la Datomic, forming a graph. This has been flexible enough for us to quickly build new features, like canvases and nested pages, without committing to a single document structure.
- We use ProseMirror, but not for the entire document. Instead every text block is a separate ProseMirror instance. This lets us keep the document structure in our database and our schema, without having to dive into ProseMirror's every time we want to modify things.- Better home and document organizing features — things like search, tagging, collections etc.
- We're really excited about ATProto and Bluesky and are working on a set of lexicons and an AppView for document publishing! This will include a lexicon for rich text documents, as well as one publications, and some concept of memberships or subscriptions.
- More blocks! Tables, code blocks, etc.Some things we're particularly proud of:- Our list handling
- Custom theming
- Keyboard handling on iOS Safari (and generally works excellently on mobile)
- Side-scrolling multi-page interface
- Works as a PWA!Some things that still need work:- While faster than others, still a lot of work we can do on performance, both speed when working with very large documents and loading docs generally
- Drag and drop and selection in general could be a lot nicer
- Keyboard navigation across multiple pages
- Multiplayer cursors, and generally real-time sync could be sped up greatly leveraging CRDTs (we already use YJS, just could move updates around faster)]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Unboxing a DuckyPad Pro macropad!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkI3HPnDLLY</link><author>Chyrosran22</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/vkI3HPnDLLY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 17:46:35 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD0y51PJfvkZNe3y3FR5riw">Chyrosran22</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get it here: https://www.tindie.com/products/dekunukem/duckypad-pro-macro-scripting-beyond-qmkvia/

The game's main conceit was based loosely on the Chinese literary classic The Water Margin: A young outcast and his friends gather up companions to form the 108 Stars of Destiny, building a magnificent rebel outpost and eventually toppling a wicked empire. Suikoden's success would inspire multiple sequels, including immediate follow-up Suikoden II, regarded by many as a shining gem in the PS1's RPG library.With fame and acclaim, however, comes a price tag: Original copies of Suikoden II run in the hundreds of dollars, and that's even with several well-known, game-breaking bugs that were inadvertently introduced in the English version. Here's where Konami seemingly swoops in to the rescue, offering both Suikoden I and II together for a low price and promising beautiful new HD graphics and bonus features. This was announced back in 2022, and now, two and a half years later due to delays, we finally have Suikoden I&II HD Remaster--and I'm left wondering just how all that time this remaster spent cooking in the oven was spent.First, let's talk a bit about the games themselves. I first played both of these titles back on the PS1 many years ago. The original Suikoden was the game I was most excited to revisit, as it had been well over two decades since I'd last played it, and I'd forgotten so much about it. I was pleased to rediscover a pleasant, breezy RPG with a fast-paced story, smooth turn-based combat, and a charming sense of humor. It's quite short, and with the lack of load times and addition of battle speed-up options, you can easily finish it in around 15-20 hours doing all of the optional content.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Barcelona by Bike!

This special forest is home to countless spruce and fir trees. One very special species towers above them all, giving many animals shelter: the giant arbor vitae, or ‘Tree of Life’.

The proud giant, which can live for up to a thousand years, plays an important role in the mythology of the Nuxalk. These indigenous people communicate with their ancestors through the tree. But the tree of life also plays a key role in the ecosystem and is home to numerous species - from the smallest insects to stately mammals. The animals crawl into its trunk or find shelter under its bushy foliage. 

The giant arbor vitae has watched over the Canadian rainforest and the adjacent ocean for thousands of years. Every fall, the salmon return to their native rivers in the middle of the Great Bear Rainforest after spending several years at sea. They fight their way upstream to spawn - and provide a feast for the bears, who devour the delicious fish in the shade of the trees. 
Nothing is lost in the forest. Scavengers feed on any remains left among the tree roots and whatever is left nourishes the rich forest soil with nitrogen and phosphorus. Thus, even the salmon promote tree growth and contribute to a unique ecosystem. 

Forest and ocean live in symbiosis here. When heavy rainfall erodes the soil, nutrients are transported through the rivers to the sea, where they benefit the humpback whales. Nowadays, however, this complex ecosystem is threatened by massive logging. Here, too, humans are jeopardizing a balance that has existed for thousands of years.

ABSTRACT
New web libraries constantly emerge, promising to solve our previous coding dilemmas. But what if we revisit the fundamentals? Embrace simplicity and speed using Vanilla JS, modern browser APIs, and different server architectures, including site generators.

Let’s talk about embracing the simplicity and speed of development that comes with a ‘vanilla’ approach.

This session is all about exploring how to craft rich web apps and websites using nothing but the HTTP protocol, core JavaScript, and browser APIs—no dependencies, just pure power! If you have never created apps with Vanilla JS or without a library, now is the perfect time to understand it.

We’ll journey through the modern landscape of JavaScript’s foundational features, which have evolved into a robust suite of tools. From Web Components to Shadow DOM, reactivity and declarative templates, PWA APIs, reactive programming, and client-side routing, we’ll uncover how to harness these powerful features typically provided by libraries.

We’ll also delve into server-side architectures and how to use static site generators for some websites and web apps.

Let’s rediscover the potential of returning to the roots of web development and see what your code can do without libraries or frameworks! [...]

It relies on protocols such as Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)  , Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)  , and Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP)  to establish direct connections across varied network environments. While its foundational mechanics are well-documented, practical implementation reveals subtleties in areas like NAT traversal, signaling, DataChannel management, and congestion control that can impact performance and reliability. This post examines core concepts and technical details for developers building WebRTC applications.Signaling and Initial Connection SetupWebRTC relies on an out-of-band signaling channel to coordinate the initial connection between peers, a mechanism not prescribed by the W3C WebRTC 1.0 specification but essential for exchanging Session Description Protocol (SDP) offers, answers, and ICE candidates, as outlined in  . SDP, a format for describing session parameters like codecs and transport options, is typically transmitted over a WebSocket connection to a centralized server in most deployments, the. This choice reflects WebSockets’ support for real-time, bidirectional communication, making them well-suited for the low-latency requirements of WebRTC signaling, but it can be any equivalent. The process begins with one peer generating an SDP offer via the CreateOffer() method, committing it locally with SetLocalDescription(), and sending it to the remote peer through the signaling connection. The receiving peer applies this offer as its remote description using SetRemoteDescription(), generates an answer with CreateAnswer(), sets it locally, and returns it. Once both peers have established their local and remote descriptions, they exchange ICE candidates—network endpoint details like IP addresses and ports—to finalize the connection.Peer A creates offer with CreateOffer()Peer A sets offer locally with SetLocalDescription()Peer A sends offer via the siganling connection to Peer BPeer B sets offer as remote with SetRemoteDescription(), sends answer backPeer A sets answer as remote with SetRemoteDescription()While WebSockets dominate due to their efficiency, alternatives like HTTP polling or REST APIs can serve simpler use cases, though their request-response model introduces measurable latency, often on the order of tens to hundreds of milliseconds depending on network conditions. By contrast, Magic Wormhole provides a non-WebRTC example, using a rendezvous server to facilitate P2P setup with its own encrypted transport, distinct from WebRTC’s ICE-based approach. In practice, WebRTC applications favor WebSockets or similar protocols for their balance of practicality and performance.PeerConnection and DataChannel Multiplexing*The RTCPeerConnection object, as defined in  , manages WebRTC’s transport layer, overseeing ICE negotiation, DTLS encryption, and the SCTP association for DataChannels. A single PeerConnection can multiplex multiple streams, making it efficient to handle diverse communication types, een text messaging, file transfers, or telemetry—within one instance. Establishing additional PeerConnections incurs overhead: ICE negotiation takes 100-500 milliseconds depending on network conditions and candidate gathering, DTLS handshakes often require 50-200 milliseconds for key exchange, and SCTP setup adds further delay. Multiplexing DataChannels avoids these costs, centralizing transport management and reducing signaling complexity.DataChannels operate over a single SCTP association within a PeerConnection, identified by 16-bit stream IDs (0-65535) as specified in  . After the initial SDP negotiation establishes the SCTP association, new DataChannels can be created dynamically using CreateDataChannel() without additional offer/answer exchanges, a feature enabled by WebRTC’s design (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3 ). When one peer creates a DataChannel, the remote peer receives it via the OnDataChannel event, allowing immediate handler attachment. If both peers independently create DataChannels with the same label, WebRTC treats them as distinct unless explicitly coordinated with the negotiated: true option and a matching id, an option available for specific synchronization use cases. All DataChannels share SCTP’s congestion control, meaning high traffic on one channel—such as a multi-megabyte file transfer—can reduce throughput for others, a behavior governed by the SCTP congestion algorithms, occasionally necessitating data rate management.Using multiple PeerConnections is warranted only in specific cases: isolating traffic, routing through distinct TURN relays for redundancy, or separating streams for diagnostic clarity. Otherwise, a single PeerConnection is preferable. If all DataChannels close and no media tracks remain, the PeerConnection persists per the specification, but some implementations (e.g., older browsers) may terminate it after an idle timeout, typically 5-60 seconds, unless keep-alive traffic maintains activity. A low-bandwidth DataChannel sending periodic messages can mitigate this risk, ensuring the connection remains available for future use.ICE, NAT Traversal, and STUN/TURN MechanicsICE enables WebRTC to traverse Network Address Translators (NATs) by systematically evaluating network paths. It gathers candidates from local interfaces (host candidates), STUN servers (server-reflexive candidates), and TURN relays (relay candidates), testing them to establish connectivity. , formalized in  , sends candidates incrementally as they are discovered, allowing peers to begin connectivity checks immediately — typically reducing setup time by 50–200 milliseconds compared to Full ICE, which collects all candidates before SDP exchange. Most WebRTC implementations default to Trickle ICE for its efficiency nowadays.STUN servers, per  , query a peer’s public IP and port mapping behind a NAT, assuming the NAT permits some inbound traffic via techniques like UDP hole punching. This fails with Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT), where ISPs assign multiple users a shared public IP and block inbound connections, rendering direct P2P infeasible. TURN servers, defined in  , address this by relaying all traffic: both peers establish outbound connections to the same TURN server, which proxies data between them. This process doubles bandwidth usage — for a 1Mbps stream, the TURN server handles 1Mbps inbound and 1Mbps outbound — making it resource-intensive and costly compared to STUN’s lightweight discovery role. TURN servers must be identical for both peers to form a relay path, whereas STUN servers can differ since they only provide mapping data, a distinction rooted in their respective protocol designs.Candidate exchange timing is important: candidates are gathered only  SetLocalDescription() commits the local SDP, ensuring ICE’s state machine progresses correctly. The remote peer processes candidates after SetRemoteDescription(), though some implementations (e.g., browsers like Chrome) buffer early candidates, while others (e.g.,  ) may discard them, leading to potential connectivity delays if not synchronized properly.Peer A sets local description, starts gathering candidatesPeer A sends candidate to Peer B when OnIceCandidate firesPeer B sets remote description, processes candidatePeer B sends its candidate back to Peer ABoth peers connect using received candidatesDataChannel Lifecycle and the OnOpen() ChallengeDataChannels introduce lifecycle considerations, notably with the OnOpen() event, which fires when the local system deems the SCTP stream usable (W3C WebRTC 1.0, Section 6.3). This does not confirm remote readiness; the remote peer may not have attached an OnMessage handler, risking data loss if messages are sent immediately. In cases where data loss is a concern, consider a handshake after OnOpen() and before transmitting substantive data. This ensures both peers—and any external logic, like TCP-to-WebRTC bridges—are fully initialized, aligning with observed best practices in WebRTC deployments.Messages arriving before OnMessage is set are buffered by SCTP, but the buffer size varies by implementation—typically 256KB in browsers like Chrome and Firefox, configurable in libraries like Pion via MaxMessageSize. If this buffer overflows due to delayed handler attachment, older messages are dropped, necessitating prompt handler setup or application-level buffering for critical payloads. Post-connection, new DataChannels trigger OnDataChannel on the remote peer without signaling, leveraging the existing SCTP association. Closing all DataChannels leaves the PeerConnection intact, allowing later creation, though NAT timeouts (15-60 seconds per  ) or implementation-specific idle policies may necessitate keep-alive messages.Peer A and B complete initial connection setupPeer A creates DataChannel “chat” with CreateDataChannel()Peer A’s OnOpen fires, channel is ready locallyPeer B’s OnDataChannel fires, detects “chat”Peer B’s OnOpen fires, channel is readySCTP: Data Framing, Congestion, and ReliabilityDataChannels utilize SCTP over DTLS, offering reliable, message-oriented transport distinct from TCP’s stream model or UDP’s unreliability, per RFC 4960 and RFC 8832. SCTP preserves message boundaries, delivering complete payloads to OnMessage without reassembly. Browser implementations cap Send() at approximately 16MB (e.g., Chrome’s WebRTC internals), while SCTP’s default send/receive buffer is around 256KB, adjustable in libraries like Pion. Messages exceeding this buffer can block transmission, requiring manual chunking, e.g., into 64KB segments with sequence IDs, followed by reassembly on receipt, signaled by a final small packet.SCTP’s congestion control operates across all DataChannels in a PeerConnection, throttling sends based on network feedback like round-trip time and packet loss. Heavy traffic on one channel can degrade others, a shared constraint observable via the BufferedAmount() API. The OnBufferedAmountLow() event fires when the send buffer drops below a threshold (default 64KB in Pion), guiding pacing to avoid overflow, which can force channel closure in extreme cases. Unlike TCP, SCTP lacks guaranteed delivery if the PeerConnection fails mid-transfer; dropped messages require application-level acknowledgments, such as sequence number tracking, to ensure reliability for critical data.Maintaining Connection StabilityNetwork dynamics challenge WebRTC’s stability, particularly with NATs and firewalls. UDP NAT mappings expire after 15–60 seconds of inactivity (RFC 4787), necessitating keep-alive messages — e.g., a “ping” every 5–30 seconds via a DataChannel — to sustain bindings. TURN servers impose their own timeouts, often configurable (e.g., 10 minutes in Coturn), requiring periodic traffic to maintain relay sessions. Network changes, such as switching from Wi-Fi to cellular, may disrupt connectivity, addressable by an ICE restart — renegotiating SDP to update candidates per RFC 8835. Logging PeerConnectionState transitions (“connected” to “disconnected” to “failed”) identifies these disruptions, enabling recovery actions like re-establishing the connection or switching to TURN.Peer A sends STUN candidate, no responsePeer B can’t connect via STUN (e.g., CGNAT)Peer A switches to TURN server candidatePeer B uses same TURN server candidateConnection works through TURN relay Debugging and Optimization StrategiesDebugging hinges on comprehensive logging. Monitoring PeerConnectionState tracks connection lifecycle events, while OnIceCandidate verifies candidate exchange—missing candidates often signal NAT traversal failures resolvable with TURN or refined STUN configurations. The OnBufferedAmountLow() callback detects congestion when BufferedAmount() exceeds typical thresholds (e.g., 256KB), indicating a slow receiver. Optimization includes reducing ICE setup time by limiting STUN queries (e.g., one server per region) or prioritizing host candidates, though this risks connectivity if NAT traversal fails. For TURN, short-lived credentials (e.g., 24-hour expiry) and bandwidth caps control costs, while tuning SCTP’s MaxMessageSize (default 256KB in Pion) supports high-throughput use cases, balancing performance with reliability.PeerConnectionState changes to “connecting”OnIceCandidate shows new candidatePeerConnectionState changes to “connected”OnDataChannel detects new channelOnBufferedAmountLow shows buffer statusWebRTC provides a robust framework for P2P communication, requiring however signaling over e.g. WebSockets. Applications need to be designed with considerations for multiplexing DataChannels, managing ICE and NAT traversal, handling SCTP congestion, and ensuring connection stability each require deliberate attention. Keep in mind that WebRTC is primarily used for real-time peer-to-peer communication in applications like video conferencing, voice calls, live streaming, and data sharing, but it is not suitable for broadcasting, persistent background tasks, or bulk data transfers.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>A 1940s Sweet Treat!</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjfCagi35IM</link><author>Imperial War Museums</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bjfCagi35IM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 5 Mar 2025 12:01:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3uAjWoLZ4bSi6qI9SjALxA">Imperial War Museums</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[A clip from the Ministry of Food's WW2 rationing adverts: "Food Flashes".

But this isn’t just a story about technology—it’s about the people shaping it, the competing ideologies driving them, and the enormous consequences of getting this right (or wrong).

For a long time, AI was something most people didn’t have to think about, but that’s no longer the case. The decisions being made right now—about who controls AI, how it’s trained, and what it should or shouldn’t be allowed to do—are already changing the world.
The people trying to build these systems don’t agree on what should happen next – or even on what exactly it is they’re creating. Some call it artificial general intelligence (AGI), others refer to it as “the magic intelligence in the sky.” OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has even compared it to creating a god.

But whether AI is a true existential risk or just another overhyped tech trend, one thing is certain: the stakes are getting higher, and the fight over what kind of intelligence we’re building is only beginning.

The backbone were its superbly trained legions, with excellent equipment, training and motivation. They used to be conscripted citizens in the Republic proper, but became long-serving professionals by Casaer's day, when he achieved the ultimate triumph over the long-rival cents by conquering Gaul. They were however accompanied by a comparable number of 'auxiliaries', troop recruited from conquered people without citizenship, paid half and given the dirty jobs, but eager to win the status of full Roman. Under the Empire, the army gradually evolved, including weapons and recruitment. The Germanic tries proved the ultimate challenge, their forest homelands impossible to conquer by established Riman tactics, Varrus even incurred an unprecedented defeat. Ultimately they and other 'barbarians', having learned a lot from Rome, would overrun it.

Virtual machines often run inside hosting environments to prevent one customer from being able to access or control the resources of other customers. By breaking out of one customer’s isolated VM environment, a threat actor could take control of the hypervisor that apportions each VM. From there, the attacker could access the VMs of multiple customers, who often use these carefully controlled environments to host their internal networks.“If you can escape to the hypervisor you can access every system,” security researcher Kevin Beaumont said on Mastodon. “If you can escape to the hypervisor, all bets are off as a boundary is broken.” He added: “With this vuln you’d be able to use it to traverse VMware managed hosting providers, private clouds orgs have built on prem etc.”]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Turns out we’re all floating in a plasma soup! 🌌</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT-YiNaeNeg</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eT-YiNaeNeg?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 20:50:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

These establishments were especially important for those who didn’t have kitchens at home, offering pre-prepared food like grilled meats, vegetables, cheese, and even heated wine. The thermopolia were found near busy urban areas like the forum and the baths, providing a quick and affordable dining experience for Romans on the go.

We visit Ostia Antica, the port city of Rome, where frescoes still depict typical menu items, such as olives, eggs, and cheese. These establishments also featured large jars of wine, grills, and sometimes patios for customers to relax while enjoying their meals. Fast food joints in ancient Rome were fun, quick, and cheap, similar to modern street food.

More on Ancient Roman Fast Food
Shopping at outdoor markets, like the Campo de' Fiori in Rome, was also a major part of daily life. Just like in antiquity, locals would come to these markets to buy fresh produce like chicory, beans, and figs. Roman cuisine, often simple and reliant on staples such as legumes and leafy greens, reflected the broader Mediterranean diet.

For those who couldn’t afford proper apartments, cooking at home was risky due to fire hazards and the lack of chimneys. This meant many residents of insulas—multi-story buildings in Rome—relied on nearby bars and eateries for their daily meals. The episode also delves into Pompeii, where paintings in a bar depict patrons enjoying wine and rolling dice, giving us a glimpse of the vibrant social life centered around these dining establishments.

Fish and seafood were also popular in Roman cuisine. The Romans loved octopus, squid, sardines, and more, which they often paired with garum, a fermented fish sauce that acted as a condiment much like ketchup today. Markets like the Mercato di Testaccio in modern Rome continue the ancient tradition of offering quick, flavorful meals, giving us a taste of how Romans ate thousands of years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>CNCF Deaf and Hard of Hearing WG at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America 2024</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY8bb_SkDxQ</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/bY8bb_SkDxQ?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 19:55:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Paul Mecurio explore the cutting-edge science of plasma physics and fusion energy with Fatima Ebrahimi, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Lab.

We begin by breaking down the basics: What is plasma, and why is it essential for fusion? From the glowing plasma balls at novelty stores to the fusion reactions powering the sun, we explore how charged particles interact and what it takes to heat plasma to fusion-level temperatures.

Fusion research has been ongoing for decades, but when will we finally achieve break-even energy? Fatima explains the different fusion approaches—from Princeton’s tokamak designs to Livermore’s laser-driven experiments—and why density, temperature, and magnetic fields play a crucial role. We discuss the major breakthroughs, the challenge of scaling fusion for commercial energy production, and whether we are truly just a decade away from a fusion-powered future.

But fusion isn’t just about energy—it’s also key to the next generation of space travel. Learn about plasma propulsion: Could this ultra-efficient rocket technology one day take us to Mars and beyond? We explore how fusion-powered spacecraft could revolutionize deep-space exploration, the challenges of decelerating at high speeds, and whether future missions will rely on in-space refueling using hydrogen from the cosmos.

Finally, we take a cosmic perspective on the patience and persistence required for scientific progress. Will fusion power be ready in our lifetime? What role will AI play in accelerating breakthroughs? All this and more in a charged-up episode of StarTalk!

The World Food Programme says nearly 25 million people are facing acute food shortages - all driven by a war that has received little international attention.

Aid organizations warn that the dimension of the crisis surpasses those in Ukraine, Gaza and Somalia combined. The conflict has been running since 2023, pitting army chief and de facto president Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan against his former deputy Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo, leader of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF. The fighting has displaced 12 million people, roughly a quarter of the population. Yet, the crisis is barely present in the international media. That’s partly because journalists are rarely given access to the war zone. But DW correspondent Mariel Müller managed to secure permission to film from the Sudanese army. Embedded with military forces, she traveled to the capital Khartoum, where the paramilitary RSF control swathes of territory and the battle for dominance continues to rage - leaving the civilian population trapped in the crossfire. And the conflict shows no signs of ending soon.

Climate change, droughts, and unchecked urban growth have pushed this high-tech metropolis to the brink.  

But Bengaluru isn't alone. Beijing, Mexico City, Barcelona, Melbourne, and Cape Town are among 10 megacities that could be close to Day Zero—the critical point when a city or region's water reserves reach such low levels that the taps run dry. With global warming intensifying, cities everywhere are undergoing a stress test for survival.  

However, in Bengaluru's case, experts believe that water literacy—understanding and managing water better—can help secure the city’s future.  

Are there community-led initiatives to save water where you live?

--

Achinpur was on the precipice of demonic takeover. A mysterious woman beguiled the king and infiltrated the royal family. But she wasn’t human; under her beautiful façade lurked an insatiable appetite for flesh. One night, the demon queen devoured the king's sons — but the princes managed to evade death. Malay Bera shares the tale of their quest to free the kingdom from the scourge of demons.

Lesson by Malay Bera, directed by Ahmad Thabit, Samaka Studio.

Although this folktale exists in multiple oral variants across the Bengali-speaking world, this video is based on a variant akin to the better-known literary version, "Neelkamal and Lalkamal",  from Thakurmar Jhuli (1907), an anthology of Bengali folktales collected by Dakshinaranjan Mitra Majumdar in the early 20th century.

It's the type of game that will have you setting your controller aside to wipe away tears, both of laughter and raw emotion, as well as to call literally everyone in close proximity to come see whatever dark, hilarious, referential, or mind-blowing thing just happened. As such, I've spent the better part of the past week impatiently waiting for this embargo to drop--for the second I could talk about it with someone other than the close friend I roped into joining me. In short, Split Fiction is one of the most memorable, brilliant, and spectacular games I've ever played. And at long last, I am allowed to tell about it.With Split Fiction, Hazelight Studios solidifies itself as not only one of the most clever and innovative working studios, but as one eager to grow and utterly devoted to creativity as both an idea and act. Though Hazelight has yet to release anything less than great, it was almost shocking to see how much it had learned from--and improved upon--2021's critical darling It Takes Two. Levels and environments are vast, gorgeous, and varied; our two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are full of depth, charm, and personality; the game's seemingly endless gimmicks and gameplay mechanics, all of which are introduced at far more rapid pace than It Takes Two, are nearly all so fun, brilliant, and tightly designed that they could stand alone; and its writing, plot beats, and overall structure deliver a remarkable story that rappels from heart wrenching, commentative, darkly humorous, and brimming with joy just as fluidly as our heroines grapple-hook between buildings. Though there is a level of cheesiness that coats the game's overarching story and its primary antagonist, Rader, as a whole Split Fiction is a marvelous game that sets a new benchmark not only for Hazelight, but for co-op experiences as a whole.Despite its inevitable greatness, Split Fiction kicks off with a humble (if slightly cliched) beginning in which it introduces its protagonists: Mio Hudson and Zoe Foster. Mio and Zoe are nothing alike. Whereas Mio is an angsty, city-slicking, sci-fi enthusiast who'd sooner yank out her own tooth than open up to a stranger, the fantasy-loving Zoe is sunshine incarnate. And yet, the pair does share one thing in common: They are both unpublished writers in dire need of money and a byline.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Hilton, Marriott and Others Are Using Timeshares to Make Billions | WSJ The Economics Of</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncGLBfG-0Vc</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ncGLBfG-0Vc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 4 Mar 2025 15:01:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The U.S. timeshare industry has consolidated behind a few major brands: Hilton Grand Vacations, Marriott Vacations Worldwide and Travel + Leisure. The industry has evolved significantly from its notoriously scammy origins, having much higher standards and using more flexible points-based systems. Executives say the bait-and-switch days are behind timeshares and have rebranded them as “vacation clubs,” offering a wide range of accommodations and experiences. But there are still issues and scams to look out for when getting into a timeshare. 

WSJ explores how timeshares became a $35.7 billion dollar industry, how they work and how issues still persist in the industry.

DESCRIPTION
Adrienne Braganza, author of "Looks Good to Me: Constructive Code Reviews", and Saša Jurić, author of “Elixir in Action”, explore best practices for effective code reviews. They discuss how smaller, well-organized pull requests lead to better feedback, the importance of comment classification, and when to take discussions offline. Both emphasize that code reviews aren't just about catching bugs—they're crucial for knowledge transfer and creating cohesive codebases.

While AI tools can help with routine aspects, human judgment remains essential, especially as AI-generated code becomes more common. The speakers agree that when done well, code reviews become one of the most valuable practices in software development.

Users in distant regions experience significant latency, slow load times, and frustrating buffering issues. The farther they are from your server, the longer it takes for data to travel across the network, degrading their experience.To fix this, you need a way to bring your content physically closer to your users, reducing the distance data must travel.This is exactly what a Content Delivery Network (CDN) does.In this article, we will explore what a CDN is, how it works, its benefits, different use-cases, and popular CDN providers.A CDN is a geographically distributed network of servers that work together to deliver  (like HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos) to users based on their .The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to end-users with  and  by reducing the physical distance between the server and the user.When a user requests content from a website, the CDN redirects the request to the nearest server in its network,  and A  operates using three key components: – The primary servers where the original content is stored. – Directs user requests to the nearest edge server instead of the origin server.By leveraging edge servers distributed across multiple geographical regions, CDNs minimize latency and accelerate content delivery. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how a CDN works: – A user visits a website and requests content, such as an image, a webpage, or a video. This request must be  that can serve the content. – The browser  to resolve the web content address (e.g., https://cdn.example.com/images/logo.png) into an IP address. The DNS return the nearest CDN edge server’s IP address rather than the origin server.If the content is  at the edge server, it is served immediately to the user.If not, the edge server forwards the request to the origin server. The origin server processes the request and  to the edge server. The edge server caches the content it retrieved from the origin server. – Once cached, future requests for the same content are served directly from the edge server, reducing load on the origin and improving speed.CDNs use a Time-to-Live (TTL) mechanism to determine how long content remains cached before expiring. To ensure users always receive the latest version, CDNs periodically refresh and update cached content from the origin server. – By serving content from the nearest edge server, CDNs reduce latency and improve page load speed. – CDNs offload traffic from the origin server by caching static assets, reducing resource consumption.Improved Availability and Reliability – With multiple servers in different locations, CDNs prevent single points of failure.: CDNs can handle traffic spikes more efficiently than traditional hosting, making them ideal for websites with fluctuating traffic patterns.: CDNs make it easier to deliver content to users worldwide, regardless of their location. – Many CDNs offer DDoS protection, Web Application Firewalls (WAFs), and bot mitigation to secure applications.While CDNs offer many benefits, it’s important to note that they also introduce some challenges like: Integrating a CDN requires proper DNS configuration, cache rules, and content invalidation policies.Many CDN providers charge based on bandwidth usage and request volume. For high-traffic websites, CDN costs , especially for video streaming, gaming, and software distribution.Accelerating Website PerformanceWebsites with  use CDNs to ensure  for users regardless of location. (images, CSS, JavaScript) at , reducing the time required to fetch them from the origin.Video Streaming & OTT PlatformsCDNs optimize video content delivery by caching video files closer to users, minimizing buffering and latency.Supports adaptive bitrate streaming (ABR) to serve video based on the user’s internet speed.Netflix, YouTube, and Spotify use CDNs to serve videos and music in real-time to user.Multiplayer  require  content delivery to ensure a smooth gaming experience.CDNs help distribute game updates, patches, and downloadable content (DLCs) faster.Content & Media DistributionNews websites and content platforms deliver images, articles, and videos through a CDN to handle large traffic spikes.Software Distribution & UpdatesOperating system and software vendors use CDNs to distribute large files, updates, and patches quickly.Accelerates the distribution of software updates and applications to users worldwide. Microsoft, Apple, and Google use CDNs for distributing Windows updates, macOS updates, and Android app downloads.Here are some of the most widely used CDN providers:: One of the oldest and largest CDN providers, known for its extensive global network and robust security features.: Offers a comprehensive suite of performance and security services, including a free tier for smaller websites.: Known for its real-time content delivery and edge computing capabilities.: Integrated with AWS, provides seamless scalability and extensive integration with other AWS services.: Leverages Google’s global network infrastructure to ensure high performance and low-latency content delivery. – Designed for applications hosted on Microsoft Azure, providing seamless integration with other Azure services.Selecting the best CDN depends on your , , and platform integration requirements. Cloudflare and Fastly are great for performance and security, while CloudFront, Google Cloud CDN, and Azure CDN offer seamless cloud integration. Akamai is a preferred choice for high-scale enterprise applications requiring a robust global network.A Content Delivery Network is an essential tool for any online service aiming to deliver content quickly and reliably to a global audience.By understanding how CDNs work, the benefits they offer, and how to choose and implement the right one, you can significantly enhance the performance, security, and scalability of your web applications.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.This post is public so feel free to share it.

Let’s start with some introductions, could you tell us a
bit about yourself, your role and how you got involved in Kubernetes. Hello, I am Benjamin. I am a SIG etcd Tech Lead and one of the etcd maintainers. I
work for VMware, which is part of the Broadcom group. I got involved in Kubernetes & etcd & CSI
(Container Storage Interface)
because of work and also a big passion for open source. I have been working on Kubernetes & etcd
(and also CSI) since 2020. Hey team, I’m James, a co-chair for SIG etcd and etcd maintainer. I work at Red Hat as a
Specialist Architect helping people adopt cloud native technology. I got involved with the
Kubernetes ecosystem in 2019. Around the end of 2022 I noticed how the etcd community and project
needed help so started contributing as often as I could. There is a saying in our community that
"you come for the technology, and stay for the people": for me this is absolutely real, it’s been a
wonderful journey so far and I’m excited to support our community moving forward. Hey everyone, I'm Marek, the SIG etcd lead. At Google, I lead the GKE etcd team, ensuring
a stable and reliable experience for all GKE users. My Kubernetes journey began with SIG
Instrumentation, where I
created and led the Kubernetes Structured Logging effort.
I'm still the main project lead for Kubernetes Metrics Server,
providing crucial signals for autoscaling in Kubernetes. I started working on etcd 3 years ago,
right around the 3.5 release. We faced some challenges, but I'm thrilled to see etcd now the most
scalable and reliable it's ever been, with the highest contribution numbers in the project's
history. I'm passionate about distributed systems, extreme programming, and testing. Hi there, my name is Wenjia, I am the co-chair of SIG etcd and one of the etcd
maintainers. I work at Google as an Engineering Manager, working on GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine)
and GDC (Google Distributed Cloud). I have been working in the area of open source Kubernetes and
etcd since the Kubernetes v1.10 and etcd v3.1 releases. I got involved in Kubernetes because of my
job, but what keeps me in the space is the charm of the container orchestration technology, and more
importantly, the awesome open source community.Frederico: Excellent, thank you. I'd like to start with the origin of the SIG itself: SIG etcd is
a very recent SIG, could you quickly go through the history and reasons behind its creation?: Absolutely! SIG etcd was formed because etcd is a critical component of Kubernetes,
serving as its data store. However, etcd was facing challenges like maintainer turnover and
reliability issues. Creating a dedicated SIG
allowed us to focus on addressing these problems, improving development and maintenance processes,
and ensuring etcd evolves in sync with the cloud-native landscape.Frederico: And has becoming a SIG worked out as expected? Better yet, are the motivations you just
described being addressed, and to what extent?: It's been a positive change overall. Becoming a SIG has brought more structure and
transparency to etcd's development. We've adopted Kubernetes processes like KEPs
(Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals
and PRRs (Production Readiness Reviews,
which has improved our feature development and release cycle.Frederico: On top of those, what would you single out as the major benefit that has resulted from
becoming a SIG?: The biggest benefits for me was adopting Kubernetes testing infrastructure, tools like
Prow and TestGrid. For large projects like
etcd there is just no comparison to the default GitHub tooling. Having known, easy to use, clear
tools is a major boost to the etcd as it makes it much easier for Kubernetes contributors to also
help etcd.: Totally agree, while challenges remain, the SIG structure provides a solid foundation
for addressing them and ensuring etcd's continued success as a critical component of the Kubernetes
ecosystem.The positive impact on the community is another crucial aspect of SIG etcd's success that I’d like
to highlight. The Kubernetes SIG structure has created a welcoming environment for etcd
contributors, leading to increased participation from the broader Kubernetes community. We have had
greater collaboration with other SIGs like SIG API
Machinery,
SIG Scalability,
SIG Testing,
SIG Cluster Lifecycle, etc.This collaboration helps ensure etcd's development aligns with the needs of the wider Kubernetes
ecosystem. The formation of the etcd Operator Working Group
under the joint effort between SIG etcd and SIG Cluster Lifecycle exemplifies this successful
collaboration, demonstrating a shared commitment to improving etcd's operational aspects within
Kubernetes.Frederico: Since you mentioned collaboration, have you seen changes in terms of contributors and
community involvement in recent months?: Yes -- as showing in our
unique PR author data
we recently hit an all time high in March and are trending in a positive direction:Frederico: That's quite telling, thank you. In terms of the near future, what are the current
priorities for SIG etcd?: Reliability is always top of mind -– we need to make sure etcd is rock-solid. We're also
working on making etcd easier to use and manage for operators. And we have our sights set on making
etcd a viable standalone solution for infrastructure management, not just for Kubernetes. Oh, and of
course, scaling -– we need to ensure etcd can handle the growing demands of the cloud-native world.: I agree that reliability should always be our top guiding principle. We need to ensure
not only correctness but also compatibility. Additionally, we should continuously strive to improve
the understandability and maintainability of etcd. Our focus should be on addressing the pain points
that the community cares about the most.Frederico: Are there any specific SIGs that you work closely with?: SIG API Machinery, for sure – they own the structure of the data etcd stores, so we're
constantly working together. And SIG Cluster Lifecycle – etcd is a key part of Kubernetes clusters,
so we collaborate on the newly created etcd operator Working group.: Other than SIG API Machinery and SIG Cluster Lifecycle that Marek mentioned above, SIG
Scalability and SIG Testing is another group that we work closely with.Frederico: In a more general sense, how would you list the key challenges for SIG etcd in the
evolving cloud native landscape?: Well, reliability is always a challenge when you're dealing with critical data. The
cloud-native world is evolving so fast that scaling to meet those demands is a constant effort.Frederico: We're almost at the end of our conversation, but for those interested in in etcd, how
can they get involved?: We'd love to have them! The best way to start is to join our
SIG etcd meetings,
follow discussions on the etcd-dev mailing list, and check
out our GitHub issues. We're always looking for people to
review proposals, test code, and contribute to documentation.: I love this question 😀 . There are numerous ways for people interested in contributing
to SIG etcd to get involved and make a difference. Here are some key areas where you can help:: Tackle existing issues in the etcd codebase. Start with issues labeled "good first
issue" or "help wanted" to find tasks that are suitable for newcomers.: Contribute to the development of new features and enhancements. Check the
etcd roadmap and discussions to see what's being planned and where your skills might fit in.: Help ensure the quality of etcd by writing tests, reviewing code
changes, and providing feedback.: Improve etcd's documentation by adding new content,
clarifying existing information, or fixing errors. Clear and comprehensive documentation is
essential for users and contributors.: Answer questions on forums, mailing lists, or Slack channels.
Helping others understand and use etcd is a valuable contribution.: Start by joining the etcd community on Slack,
attending SIG meetings, and following the mailing lists. This will
help you get familiar with the project, its processes, and the
people involved.: If you're new to open source or etcd, consider
finding a mentor who can guide you and provide support. Stay tuned!
Our first cohort of mentorship program was very successful. We will
have a new round of mentorship program coming up.: Don't be afraid to start with small contributions. Even
fixing a typo in the documentation or submitting a simple bug fix
can be a great way to get involved.By contributing to etcd, you'll not only be helping to improve a
critical piece of the cloud-native ecosystem but also gaining valuable
experience and skills. So, jump in and start contributing!Frederico: Excellent, thank you. Lastly, one piece of advice that
you'd like to give to other newly formed SIGs?: Absolutely! My advice would be to embrace the established
processes of the larger community, prioritize collaboration with other
SIGs, and focus on building a strong community.: Here are some tips I myself found very helpful in my OSS
journey:: Open source development can take time. Don't get
discouraged if your contributions aren't accepted immediately or if
you encounter challenges.: The etcd community values collaboration and
respect. Be mindful of others' opinions and work together to achieve
common goals.: Contributing to open source should be
enjoyable. Find areas that interest you and contribute in ways that
you find fulfilling.Frederico: A great way to end this spotlight, thank you all!For more information and resources, please take a look at :]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How to install KSH on FreeBSD</title><link>https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-install-ksh-kornshell-on-freebsd/</link><author>Vivek Gite</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 23:50:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.cyberciti.biz/atom/">Dev - NixCraft</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[nstalling KSH (KornShell) on FreeBSD can be done with either FreeBSD ports or the pkg command. The ports collection will download the KSH source code, compile it, and install it on the system. The pkg method is easier, and it will download a pre-compiled binary package. Hence, it is recommended for all users. KornShell (KSH) has a long history, and many older Unix systems and scripts rely on it. As a result, KSH remains relevant for maintaining and supporting legacy infrastructure. Large enterprises, especially those with established Unix-based systems, continue to use KSH for scripting and system administration tasks. Some industries where KSH is still commonly used include finance and telecommunications. While Bash has become the dominant shell in many Linux distributions, KSH still holds a significant presence in Unix-like environments, particularly in legacy systems. Therefore, installing KSH and practicing with it is worthwhile if you plan to work in such environments.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Researchers surprised to find less-educated areas adopting AI writing tools faster</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-surprised-to-find-less-educated-areas-adopting-ai-writing-tools-faster/</link><author>Benj Edwards</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/virtual_typewriter_hero-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 22:32:59 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022, experts have debated how widely AI language models would impact the world.

The average American is 39 years old - which is half the age of the sitting president - Donald Trump. 
When Ronald Reagan was inaugurated at 69 years old, he became the oldest person to have ever served as president. Donald Trump and Joe Biden are even older and are now - the two oldest men to ever be inaugurated as president. 

The average ages in the House and Senate at 58 and 64, are significantly older than the average American. A word often used to describe the nation’s governing class is “gerontocracy” - meaning government based on rule by old people.

It's not just in the US either - around the world our political leaders are older than ever before.  Why has this happened?

As a shadow war heats up in the Baltic Sea over critical subsea cables, NATO’s newest member is on the front lines with a strategic island called Gotland. Troops here are training in drills to repel invaders, readying civilian bomb shelters built during the Cold War and more. 

WSJ’s Sune Engel Rasmussen visits Gotland to understand why it’s undergoing a radical transformation and how the new defenses are dividing opinion among locals.

A stream refers to a source or destination for bytes. In other words, sed can read its input from standard input (stdin), apply the specified edits to the stream, and automatically output the results to standard output (stdout). Sed syntax allows an input file to be specified on the command line. However, the syntax does not directly support output file specification; this can be achieved through output redirection or editing files in place while making a backup of the original copy optionally. Sed is one of the most powerful tools on Linux and Unix-like systems. Learning it is worthwhile, so in this tutorial, we will start with the sed command syntax and examples.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Can TrapC Fix C and C++ Memory Safety Issues?</title><link>https://developers.slashdot.org/story/25/03/03/0654205/can-trapc-fix-c-and-c-memory-safety-issues?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>EditorDavid</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Mon, 3 Mar 2025 08:34:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://developers.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Dev</source><content:encoded><![CDATA["TrapC, a fork of the C language, is being developed as a potential solution for memory safety issues that have hindered the C and C++ languages," reports InfoWorld. 
But also being developed is a compiler named trapc "intended to be implemented as a cybersecurity compiler for C and C++ code, said developer Robin Rowe..."

 Due by the end of this year, trapc will be a free, open source compiler similar to Clang... Rowe said. TrapC has pointers that are memory-safe, addressing the memory safety issue with the two languages. With TrapC, developers write in C or C++ and compile in TrapC, for memory safety... 
Rowe presented TrapC at an ISO C meeting this week. Developers can download a TrapC whitepaper and offer Rowe feedback. According to the whitepaper, TrapC's memory management is automatic and cannot leak memory. Pointers are lifetime-managed, not garbage-collected. Also, TrapC reuses a few code safety features from C++, notably member functions, constructors, destructors, and the new keyword. 

"TrapC Memory Safe Pointers will not buffer overrun and will not segfault," Rowe told the ISO C Committee standards body meeting, according to the Register. "When C code is compiled using a TrapC compiler, all pointers become Memory Safe Pointers and are checked."
 
In short, TrapC "is a programming language forked from C, with changes to make it LangSec and Memory Safe," according to that white paper. "To accomplish that, TrapC seeks to eliminate all Undefined Behavior in the C programming language..." 

"The startup TRASEC and the non-profit Fountain Abode have a TrapC compiler in development, called trapc," the whitepaper adds, and their mission is "to enable recompiling legacy C code into executables that are safe by design and secure by default, without needing much code refactoring... The TRASEC trapc cybersecurity compiler with AI code reasoning is expected to release as free open source software sometime in 2025." 

In November the Register offered some background on the origins of TrapC...

What's Linux's marketshare on Steam? The Steam Survey numbers tell this story: 

11/24: 2.03%
12/24: 2.29%
01/25: 2.06%
02:25: 1.45% 

"The February numbers show a staggering 0.61% drop to Linux use..." reports Phoronix. But they attribute this to an sampling error:
According to the survey, it shows 50% of Steam users using the Simplified Chinese language pack [a 20% increase from the month before]. In prior months where there has been drops to Linux use, it's been correlated to wild swings in the Chinese use on Steam. This looks to be another such month. 
Of the Linux specific data, SteamOS continues to prove most popular for that Valve distribution powering the Steam Deck [at 34.67%, with Arch Linux coming in second at 9.7%]. 
AMD CPUs power around 70% of the Linux gaming systems thanks to the Steam Deck APU and AMD Ryzen being quite popular with Linux enthusiasts.

ABSTRACT
As developers, we often struggle to understand the important details of the (legacy) software systems we continuously develop.

Moldable Development is an approach to open up software systems to expose their internal domain models and make them explainable.

But how does this work in practice?

Through a series of case studies we will illustrate a number of key patterns behind moldable development. [...]

Though the package has been removed from PyPI, researchers at security platform Socket.dev say it enabled "coordinated, unauthorized music downloads from Deezer — a popular streaming service founded in France in 2007."

Although automslc, which has been downloaded over 100,000 times, purports to offer music automation and metadata retrieval, it covertly bypasses Deezer's access restrictions... The package is designed to log into Deezer, harvest track metadata, request full-length streaming URLs, and download complete audio files in clear violation of Deezer's API terms... [I]t orchestrates a distributed piracy operation by leveraging both user-supplied and hardcoded Deezer credentials to create sessions with Deezer's API. This approach enables full access to track metadata and the decryption tokens required to generate full-length track URLs. 

Additionally, the package routinely communicates with a remote server... to update download statuses and submit metadata, thereby centralizing control and allowing the threat actor to monitor and coordinate the distributed downloading operation. In doing so, automslc exposes critical track details — including Deezer IDs, International Standard Recording Codes, track titles, and internal tokens like MD5_ORIGIN (a hash used in generating decryption URLs) — which, when collected en masse, can be used to reassemble full track URLs and facilitate unauthorized downloads... 

Even if a user pays for access to the service, the content is licensed, not owned. The automslc package circumvents licensing restrictions by enabling downloads and potential redistribution, which is outside the bounds of fair use... 
"The malicious package was initially published in 2019, and its popularity (over 100,000 downloads) indicates wide distribution..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Decentralized Routing in Tor Hidden Services</title><link>https://medium.com/@kyodo-tech/decentralized-routing-in-tor-hidden-services-40e0bc0793d5?source=rss-ac02ab142942------2</link><author>Kyodo Tech</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 11:02:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://medium.com/@kyodo-tech?source=rss-ac02ab142942------2">Dev - Kyodo-Tech</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Tor hidden services facilitate anonymous, decentralized communication, obfuscating the client’s and server’s real IP addresses from each other. This is achieved through public key addressing and a multi-layered encryption and routing process that ensures no single node in the Tor network has complete knowledge of the communication path. Unlike traditional network addressing, where a domain name resolves to an IP address via DNS, hidden services derive self-authenticating .onion addresses from cryptographic public keys. This eliminates the need for a centralized registry, instead relying on a fully distributed lookup mechanism via a subset of Tor relays known as Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs).In this post, we explore how enables decentralized, anonymous routing and service discovery while mitigating surveillance and censorship.Addressing, Public Key Infrastructure, and Cryptographic IdentityEach hidden service is uniquely identified by its .onion address, which is directly derived from an Ed25519 public key. The service generates a key pair, where the private key remains confidential and is used to sign service descriptors, while the public key forms the basis of the address. The address itself is constructed by computing the Blake2b cryptographic hash of the public key, appending a checksum, encoding the result using Base32, and appending the .onion suffix. This deterministic derivation ensures that the .onion address is self-authenticating—clients can verify they are communicating with the correct service without relying on a trusted third party.# 1. Generate Ed25519 Key PairPrivate Key:  3f2a4b18d5e8a13c799b521d...Public Key:   af3d2e4c5b6a7890c123d456e...# 2. Compute Blake2b HashBlake2b(public_key) = d2c6e5f9a34b21d7f4c9823e...# 3. Compute Checksumchecksum = Blake2b(".onion checksum" || public_key || 0x03) = 8f2c918b6d7a...# 4. Construct Onion Addressonion_address_raw = public_key || checksum || 0x03onion_address = Base32(onion_address_raw) + ".onion"This cryptographic model ensures that only the entity possessing the corresponding private key can operate a given .onion address. It also means that services cannot arbitrarily select easy-to-remember addresses; instead, addresses are pseudo-random, unless techniques such as brute-force key generation (vanity address generation) are used.Hidden Service Descriptor and the Decentralized Lookup MechanismBecause .onion addresses do not resolve via DNS, Tor employs a decentralized lookup mechanism using Hidden Service Directories (HSDirs). The hidden service generates a , a structured document containing:Ed25519 Public Key: af3d2e4c5b6a7890c123d456e...Introduction Points: [node1, node2, node3]Signature: Signed(service_descriptor, private_key)Encrypted Metadata: Session keys, authentication infoThese descriptors are deterministically mapped to HSDir nodes based on a hash of the service’s public key. HSDirs store descriptors temporarily, typically expiring within an hour, requiring hidden services to refresh them periodically to maintain reachability. A client looking to access a service calculates the appropriate HSDirs by hashing the .onion address and querying the network for the latest descriptor. Blake2b(public_key) -> hsdir_index.The Distributed Hash Table (DHT) and Service Descriptor StorageTor’s hidden service discovery mechanism operates over a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) model, where descriptors are stored across a subset of nodes designated as HSDirs. The allocation of storage responsibilities is determined by a deterministic hash function, ensuring redundancy and fault tolerance. As time progresses, descriptor responsibility shifts dynamically among different relays. The ephemeral nature of descriptors and their encrypted structure makes large-scale enumeration of hidden services infeasible.When a client queries an HSDir for a descriptor, the request itself is onion-routed, ensuring that the HSDir does not learn the client’s IP address. To mitigate exploitation, Tor employs proof-of-work mechanisms and rate-limiting to prevent large-scale descriptor harvesting.Entry Guards and Circuit EstablishmentWhen a client or a hidden service establishes a connection to the Tor network, the first relay in its circuit is known as an entry guard. This relay is selected for its long-term stability and performance characteristics. Entry guards mitigate certain traffic correlation attacks by limiting exposure to malicious relays, as a client does not randomly select a new first-hop node for every connection.For clients, entry guards prevent frequent exposure to new first-hop nodes, which mitigates attacks where adversaries could rotate relays to observe multiple connections and correlate user activity.For hidden services, entry guards ensure a consistent first-hop into the Tor network. A hidden service forms circuits through introduction points and rendezvous points, but its entry guard remains stable over time, preventing attackers from easily mapping its presence.Since entry guards know the client’s real IP (or the hidden service’s real IP in a single-hop mode), their security and integrity are critical. However, because they do not know the final destination or whether the connection belongs to a hidden service, they cannot deanonymize users in a standard multi-hop configuration.Establishing a Connection: Introduction Points and Rendezvous PointsOnce the client retrieves the service descriptor, it selects an introduction point from the list contained in the descriptor. Introduction points are Tor relays preselected by the hidden service, maintaining persistent circuits to the service, enabling communication without exposing its actual network location.The client encrypts an introduction request using the service’s public key, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This request is relayed through the Tor network to the introduction point, which forwards it through its pre-established circuit to the hidden service. The service then responds by establishing a connection to a , a random Tor relay chosen by the client. Once both the client and the service connect to this relay, a bidirectional communication channel is established over separate Tor circuits, ensuring that no single entity in the network has knowledge of both endpoints.Proof-of-Work Defense Mechanism for Hidden ServicesTor’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) defense mechanism , introduced with the release of Tor 0.4.8 in August 2023, requires clients to solve computational puzzles before accessing onion services, aiming to deter Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. When an onion service detects stress, it embeds PoW parameters in its service descriptor, specifying a cryptographic challenge. The client fetches this descriptor, extracts parameters, and computes a solution using the Equi-X PoW scheme, which involves a memory-hard computational puzzle requiring RAM for efficient solving. The challenge consists of concatenated values, including a service-specific seed and nonce, hashed using the HashX function. Clients iteratively attempt solutions until they find one that meets the difficulty requirement (based on leading zero bits in a Blake2b-derived hash). The solved puzzle, nonce, and effort value are then submitted in an INTRODUCE1 message. The service verifies the solution by quickly checking its hash and the Equi-X proof, then places the request in a priority queue based on effort. Clients investing more computational work receive higher priority in the queue, ensuring that motivated users bypass attackers attempting to flood introduction requests. Dynamic difficulty tuning ensures adaptive effort adjustments based on observed attack severity, keeping the service available while discouraging large-scale automated abuse.Routing, Onion Encryption, and Traffic FlowTor’s circuit-based routing model ensures that no single node in the network possesses a complete view of a communication path. Onion encryption encapsulates messages in multiple layers, where each relay decrypts only its layer, revealing the next hop without exposing the full route.Decrypts a single encryption layer to determine the next relayForwards the partially decrypted packet without knowledge of its ultimate destinationAdds an additional layer of encryption when transmitting responses back to the clientBy the time traffic reaches the rendezvous point, both the client and the hidden service are communicating through independent Tor circuits, preventing correlation of the origin and destination.Non-Anonymous Single-Hop Hidden ServicesTor supports an alternative mode for hidden services that prioritizes performance over anonymity. By enabling HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1 and HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1, a hidden service bypasses the traditional three-hop circuit model and instead directly registers with HSDirs while accepting connections through a single-hop Tor circuit.While this significantly reduces latency, it exposes the service’s real IP address to its entry guard relay, making it traceable. This configuration is primarily used for services requiring censorship resistance but not anonymity, such as certain high-performance Tor-based applications or relays used for onion-routed content distribution.Service Availability and Scalability ConsiderationsReliability of hidden services is affected by factors including descriptor refresh rates, introduction point stability, and HSDir churn. A hidden service can improve availability by increasing the number of introduction points, ensuring resilience against relay failures. However, since the descriptor itself is the bottleneck for discovery, additional introduction points do not necessarily accelerate lookup speed. Services must ensure they remain online consistently to prevent descriptor expiration, as clients will otherwise be unable to retrieve valid routing information.To mitigate excessive load, Tor imposes limits on the number of introduction points per service. High-traffic services often deploy load-balancing mechanisms by distributing traffic across multiple onion addresses, each backed by different backend nodes. This approach prevents bottlenecks in descriptor resolution and introduction request handling.Security and Resistance to EnumerationTor’s architectural design makes hidden services resistant to large-scale enumeration and targeted de-anonymization attacks. The use of DHT-based lookup combined with ephemeral descriptors, encryption, and circuit-layer separation ensures that no single entity in the network can trivially index all hidden services. Additionally:HSDir nodes can only observe encrypted descriptors, not .onion addresses directlyIntroduction points never learn the client’s IP addressRendezvous points see only anonymized Tor circuits, preventing correlationThe self-authenticating nature of .onion addresses ensures that man-in-the-middle attacks are infeasible. Even if an attacker compromises an HSDir node, they cannot alter or forge descriptors without detection due to cryptographic signing.Decentralized Communication with Tor Hidden ServicesTor hidden services provide a censorship-resistant, decentralized alternative to traditional domain-based addressing. Unlike conventional services that rely on DNS and public IP exposure, .onion addresses are self-authenticating and do not require a central registry, making them resilient against domain seizures and network filtering.A key advantage of hidden services is their ability to function within NAT-restricted environments and firewalled networks. Unlike traditional services that rely on port forwarding, hidden services establish outbound-only Tor circuits, allowing them to function seamlessly behind NAT, carrier-grade NAT (CGNAT), and firewalls without requiring manually opened inbound ports. The service initiates outgoing circuits to introduction points, meaning that as long as the service has an outbound connection, it remains accessible — even in networks that typically block unsolicited inbound connections. This makes .onion services ideal for hosting within home networks, mobile carriers, and restricted corporate environments where traditional hosting would be infeasible without port forwarding or VPN tunneling.Multi-hop circuits remain the foundation of anonymous hidden services, while single-hop configurations offer a higher performance alternative at the cost of privacy. Despite this trade-off, .onion addressing continues to provide decentralized resolution, censorship resistance, and NAT-friendly deployment, making it viable for both anonymity-preserving and infrastructure-agnostic use cases.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Boats and Planes Are Also Going Electric</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeYySXlo8js</link><author>ColdFusion</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/zeYySXlo8js?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 04:58:34 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4QZ_LsYcvcq7qOsOhpAX4A">ColdFusion</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Join me at Everything Electric 2025.

They'd spotted a Reddit post "detailing how someone took a 27-year-old visual basic EXE file, fed it to Claude 3.7, and watched as it reverse-engineered the program and rewrote it in Python."

It was an old Visual Basic 4 program they had written in 1997. Running a VB4 exe in 2024 can be a real yak-shaving compatibility nightmare, chasing down outdated DLLs and messy workarounds. So! OP decided to upload the exe to Claude 3.7 with this request: 
"Can you tell me how to get this file running? It'd be nice to convert it to Python."> 
Claude 3.7 analyzed the binary, extracted the VB 'tokens' (VB is not a fully-machine-code-compiled language which makes this task a lot easier than something from C/C++), identified UI elements, and even extracted sound files. Then, it generated a complete Python equivalent using Pygame. According to the author, the code worked on the first try and the entire process took less than five minutes... 
Torrone speculates on what this might mean. "Old business applications and games could be modernized without needing the original source code... Tools like Claude might make decompilation and software archaeology a lot easier: proprietary binaries from dead platforms could get a new life in open-source too." 

And maybe Archive.org could even add an LLM "to do this on the fly!"]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How the Trump-Zelensky Relationship Unraveled: A Timeline | WSJ</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KtB-7_cb7Y</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/1KtB-7_cb7Y?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 2 Mar 2025 01:42:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[President Trump’s personal grievances with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky date back to his first term in office.

This week they announced that the CPAN Security Group "was authorized by the CVE Program as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)" to assign and manage CVE vulnerability identifications for Perl and CPAN Modules. 

"This is great news!" posted Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman on social media, saying the announcement came "Just in time for my talk about this very topic in a few weeks about how all open source projects should be doing this" at the Linux Foundation Member Summit in Napa, California. And Curl creator Daniel Stenberg posted "I'm with Greg Kroah-Hartman on this: all Open Source projects should become CNAs. Or team up with others to do it." (Also posting "Agreed" to the suggestion was Seth Larson, the Python Software Foundation's security developer-in-residence involved in their successful effort to become a CNA in 2023.) 

444 CNAs have now partnered with the CVE Program, according to their official web site. The announcement from PerlMonks.org:

Years ago, a few people decided during the Perl Toolchain Summit (PTS) that it would be a good idea to join forces, ideas and knowledge and start a group to monitor vulnerabilities in the complete Perl ecosystem from core to the smallest CPAN release. The goal was to follow legislation and CVE reports, and help authors in taking actions on not being vulnerable anymore. That group has grown stable over the past years and is now known as CPANSec. 

The group has several focus areas, and one of them is channeling CVE vulnerability issues. In that specific goal, a milestone has been reached: CPANSec has just been authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for Perl and modules on CPAN

Young people end up there for criminal offenses or because their parents can't cope with their rebellious children. The film follows young people in one of these institutions.

There is no way out, every step is monitored and to survive you have to be loyal to the system, not to your friends. This is no Orwellian nightmare, but the "Peach Reform School”, a Chinese juvenile detention center. The documentary, which was filmed at the school for over a year, provides deeply disturbing insights into the Chinese juvenile detention system. From the frightened 11-year-old Wenjun to the secret teenage lovers Lei-gong and Chanjuan to the rough, but ambivalent teacher Zhou Hai. The intimate access to these characters reveals victims in a system that values obedience and order over love and friendship.

So the blog post calls for a "common framework" for "defining specific, measurable criteria for achieving different levels of memory safety assurance." The hope is this gives policy makers "the technical foundation to craft effective policy initiatives and incentives promoting memory safety" leading to "a market in which vendors are incentivized to invest in memory safety." ("Customers will be empowered to recognize, demand, and reward safety.") 

In January the same Google security researchers helped co-write an article noting there are now strong memory-safety "research technologies" that are sufficiently mature: memory-safe languages (including "safer language subsets like Safe Buffers for C++"), mathematically rigorous formal verification, software compartmentalization, and hardware and software protections. (With hardware protections including things like ARM's Memory Tagging Extension and the (Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC Instructions, or "CHERI", architecture.) Google's security researchers are now calling for "a blueprint for a memory-safe future" — though Importantly, the idea is "defining the desired outcomes rather than locking ourselves into specific technologies." 

Their blog post this week again urges a practical/actionable framework that's commonly understood, but one that supports different approaches (and allowing tailoring to specific needs) while enabling objective assessment:

At Google, we're not just advocating for standardization and a memory-safe future, we're actively working to build it. We are collaborating with industry and academic partners to develop potential standards, and our joint authorship of the recent CACM call-to-action marks an important first step in this process... This commitment is also reflected in our internal efforts. We are prioritizing memory-safe languages, and have already seen significant reductions in vulnerabilities by adopting languages like Rust in combination with existing, wide-spread usage of Java, Kotlin, and Go where performance constraints permit. We recognize that a complete transition to those languages will take time. That's why we're also investing in techniques to improve the safety of our existing C++ codebase by design, such as deploying hardened libc++. 

This effort isn't about picking winners or dictating solutions. It's about creating a level playing field, empowering informed decision-making, and driving a virtuous cycle of security improvement... The journey towards memory safety requires a collective commitment to standardization. We need to build a future where memory safety is not an afterthought but a foundational principle, a future where the next generation inherits a digital world that is secure by design. 
The security researchers' post calls for "a collective commitment" to eliminate memory-safety bugs, "anchored on secure-by-design practices..." One of the blog post's subheadings? "Let's build a memory-safe future together." 

And they're urging changes "not just for ourselves but for the generations that follow."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Air and Water Can Be Turned Into eFuel</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5PI6J9ruRU</link><author>The Wall Street Journal</author><category>news</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z5PI6J9ruRU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 1 Mar 2025 15:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK7tptUDHh-RYDsdxO1-5QQ">News - Wall Street Journal</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Companies like Zero are exploring whether it's possible to economically produce eFuels.

ABSTRACT
As organisations adopt microservices - composing our various APIs, DBs, Queues and Functions has become critical to getting things done. However, the glue code that we write to stitch everything together tends to be brittle, and a constant inertia to change.

This talk explores how to leverage existing API specs (OpenAPI and gRPC) to deliver composition and federation of APIs, without writing and maintaining glue code.

We'll explore how using API Specs as First Class Citizens of our enterprise integration, along with Semantic Metadata, allows us to create a mesh of services that connect on demand, and self-adapt their middleware as services around them change.

This is an in-depth exploration into Taxi - a meta-language for annotating API specs, and TaxiQL - a query language and open source orchestration engine, which can generate and adapt integration on demand. [...]

In response to the December report, Cellebrite said it had suspended sales to “relevant customers” in Serbia.On Friday, Amnesty International said that it uncovered evidence of a new incident.

The new model seems to prove that longstanding rumors of diminishing returns in training unsupervised-learning LLMs were correct and that the so-called "scaling laws" cited by many for years have possibly met their natural end.An AI expert who requested anonymity told Ars Technica, "GPT-4.5 is a lemon!" when comparing its reported performance to its dramatically increased price, while frequent OpenAI critic Gary Marcus called the release a "nothing burger" in a blog post (though to be fair, Marcus also seems to think most of what OpenAI does is overrated).Former OpenAI researcher Andrej Karpathy wrote on X that GPT-4.5 is better than GPT-4o but in ways that are subtle and difficult to express. "Everything is a little bit better and it's awesome," he wrote, "but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Strange Alleged Sex Cult That Wears All Purple</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0UlhIRhqIs</link><author>Weird History</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Z0UlhIRhqIs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2025 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc-N24Y5OA0gqbjBwe1ttfA">Weird History</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The highly controversial Lafayette Morehouse community formed in Lafayette, California in 1968.

Democrats warn that extending the cuts will come at the expense of programs that help Americans, with the Committee for a Responsible Budget estimating that Trump’s tax priorities would reduce government revenues between $5-11 trillion over 10 years. So how have the cuts affected individuals and businesses since 2017?

You’ll find references at the bottom of this page if you want to go deeper.Once upon a time, there lived a student named Jonas.Although extremely bright, he struggled with chemistry lessons. And spent countless hours doing homework.So he was sad and frustrated.Until one day, he decides to ask for help with homework from his friend, Emma.And shares a Google Document with her.The changes have to be visible in real-time to both of them, which means a bidirectional communication pattern is necessary.Let’s quickly look into potential communication patterns to handle this use case:The client requests the server for an update, and the server responds after processing it. Although this approach is simple and efficient, the client has to request the server again for an update. So it isn’t real-time.Imagine  as automatically refreshing the browser every few seconds to check a stock’s price.The client  asks the server for an update, while the server returns an empty response if nothing has changed. It can track changes in real time.Yet there are some problems with this approach:Responsiveness depends on the interval between requests.Extra overhead from connection requests and empty responses.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  as asking a restaurant waiter for food, and then waiting at the counter until it's ready.The client requests, and the server responds only when there’s an update. Put simply, the server doesn’t send an empty response; instead, it  the request and waits for an update to occur. Yet the server sends an empty response on timeout. And client has to make an extra request to receive every change.Although it allows real-time communication, there are some problems with this approach:The server has to maintain many open connections, and it consumes resources.The client has to make a separate request for sending data to the server.So it’s inefficient for this use case.Think of  like a radio broadcast, it's one way and listeners can't talk back to the radio station.The client requests the server, and it creates an open connection with the client.The server then updates the client whenever anything changes. Yet the communication is , and the client has to make a separate request to send data to the server.So it's inefficient for this use case.Meet Trae, an adaptive AI IDE that transforms how you work, collaborating with you to run faster:Simply describe your project needs in natural language, and watch it built by Trae.Upload your design files and let Trae assist in translating your visual concepts into clean, workable code.As you code, Trae learns your project patterns and provides contextually relevant suggestions to help you code more efficiently.Google Docs use websockets for bidirectional communication in real-time.Imagine  as a telephone call, both people can talk at the same time.1. Opening a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of opening a websockets connection is called the .The client sends an HTTP GET request to the server asking for a websocket connection.The HTTP request includes specific headers.The handshake is complete and opens a Transmission Control Protocol () connection for bidirectional communication.The client and server can exchange data in both directions in real-time. It supports text and binary data formats.2. Transferring Data Through WebsocketsA websocket message can be split into frames for performance. A frame contains information such as payload data in binary syntax. A frame allows the sender to have only a small buffer to keep data. The receiver then assembles the frames to reconstruct the original websocket message.3. Closing a Websocket ConnectionThe technique of closing a websocket connection is called .The client or server can close the connection. A websocket frame with a specific code is used to signal the close. The connection is closed after the receiver acknowledges it.The server then deallocates the resources.I wrote a summary of this post (save it for later):And I’d love to connect if you’re on Twitter:Websocket is efficient because it can send updates through a single connection.Yet it needs a persistent and stateful connection between the client and server. While a server can handle only limited websocket connections because of memory and socket limitations.Although good for specific use cases, it isn’t a silver bullet for real-time communication.👋 PS - Do you want to level up at work?I’m launching system design deep dives in March 2025.But it’ll be available only to paid subscribers of this newsletter.My mission is to help you go from 0 to 1 in system design by spending less than an hour each month.

ABSTRACT
Since James Lewis and Martin Fowler wrote their paper on the microservice architectural style in 2013, a lot of words have been dedicated to the subject. But many of them propagated misunderstandings of the properties of the architectural style. Mis-associations with the Cloud Native style, and misapprehensions on how to move from monolith to microservices, meant that the architectures that emerged often bear little resemblance to the original idea; most are just distributed monoliths. Unsurprisingly these architectures are painful and costly to own. Ten years later, the resulting failure to realise the benefits promised by microservices, or a misunderstanding of what they were, has led to a backlash against microservices; now the prevalent wisdom calls for a "return to the monolith," and posters on Reddit have begun to speak of "Death by a Thousand Microservices."

This talk looks at the key misunderstandings around microservices: the problems that microservices were intended to solve; "what does micro mean?"; how to achieve independent deployability; how to avoid anti-patterns like a distributed monolith. It will also explain the problems that a monolith can't solve that cause us to choose microservices. [...]

DESCRIPTION
Daniel Terhorst-North and Julian Wood share decades of experience to offer a nuanced view of programming, governance, and product delivery. By framing programming as a socio-technical activity, they emphasize the critical role of collaboration, feedback, and sustainable practices.

The conversation challenges traditional governance models, advocating for hypothesis-driven product management and continuous feedback mechanisms. Through humorous anecdotes and hard-won wisdom, Terhorst-North inspires people to look beyond technical expertise to the broader ecosystem of teams, culture, and organizational alignment. [...]

in Kubernetes 1.29. Currently in beta, it is expected to be GA as of
1.33. The new mode fixes long-standing performance problems with the
iptables mode and all users running on systems with reasonably-recent
kernels are encouraged to try it out. (For compatibility reasons, even
once nftables becomes GA, iptables will still be the .)Why nftables? Part 1: data plane latencyThe iptables API was designed for implementing simple firewalls, and
has problems scaling up to support Service proxying in a large
Kubernetes cluster with tens of thousands of Services.In general, the ruleset generated by kube-proxy in iptables mode has a
number of iptables rules proportional to the sum of the number of
Services and the total number of endpoints. In particular, at the top
level of the ruleset, there is one rule to test each possible Service
IP (and port) that a packet might be addressed to:# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.41:80, then jump to the chain
# KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O for further processing
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace1/service1:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.41 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-XPGD46QRK7WJZT7O
# If the packet is addressed to 172.30.0.42:443, then...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace2/service2:p443 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.42 --dport 443 -j KUBE-SVC-GNZBNJ2PO5MGZ6GT
# etc...
-A KUBE-SERVICES -m comment --comment "namespace3/service3:p80 cluster IP" -m tcp -p tcp -d 172.30.0.43 --dport 80 -j KUBE-SVC-X27LE4BHSL4DOUIK
This means that when a packet comes in, the time it takes the kernel
to check it against all of the Service rules is  in the number
of Services. As the number of Services increases, both the average and
the worst-case latency for the first packet of a new connection
increases (with the difference between best-case, average, and
worst-case being mostly determined by whether a given Service IP
address appears earlier or later in the  chain).By contrast, with nftables, the normal way to write a ruleset like
this is to have a  rule, using a "verdict map" to do the
dispatch:table ip kube-proxy {
# The service-ips verdict map indicates the action to take for each matching packet.
map service-ips {
type ipv4_addr . inet_proto . inet_service : verdict
comment "ClusterIP, ExternalIP and LoadBalancer IP traffic"
elements = { 172.30.0.41 . tcp . 80 : goto service-ULMVA6XW-namespace1/service1/tcp/p80,
172.30.0.42 . tcp . 443 : goto service-42NFTM6N-namespace2/service2/tcp/p443,
172.30.0.43 . tcp . 80 : goto service-4AT6LBPK-namespace3/service3/tcp/p80,
... }
}
# Now we just need a single rule to process all packets matching an
# element in the map. (This rule says, "construct a tuple from the
# destination IP address, layer 4 protocol, and destination port; look
# that tuple up in "service-ips"; and if there's a match, execute the
# associated verdict.)
chain services {
ip daddr . meta l4proto . th dport vmap @service-ips
}
...
}
Since there's only a single rule, with a roughly  map lookup,
packet processing time is more or less constant regardless of cluster
size, and the best/average/worst cases are very similar:But note the huge difference in the vertical scale between the
iptables and nftables graphs! In the clusters with 5000 and 10,000
Services, the p50 (average) latency for nftables is about the same as
the p01 (approximately best-case) latency for iptables. In the 30,000
Service cluster, the p99 (approximately worst-case) latency for
nftables manages to beat out the p01 latency for iptables by a few
microseconds! Here's both sets of data together, but you may have to
squint to see the nftables results!:Why nftables? Part 2: control plane latencyWhile the improvements to data plane latency in large clusters are
great, there's another problem with iptables kube-proxy that often
keeps users from even being able to grow their clusters to that size:
the time it takes kube-proxy to program new iptables rules when
Services and their endpoints change.With both iptables and nftables, the total size of the ruleset as a
whole (actual rules, plus associated data) is  in the combined
number of Services and their endpoints. Originally, the iptables
backend would rewrite every rule on every update, and with tens of
thousands of Services, this could grow to be hundreds of thousands of
iptables rules. Starting in Kubernetes 1.26, we began improving
kube-proxy so that it could skip updating  of the unchanged
rules in each update, but the limitations of  as an
API meant that it was still always necessary to send an update that's
 in the number of Services (though with a noticeably smaller
constant than it used to be). Even with those optimizations, it can
still be necessary to make use of kube-proxy's  config
option to ensure that it doesn't spend every waking second trying to
push iptables updates.The nftables APIs allow for doing much more incremental updates, and
when kube-proxy in nftables mode does an update, the size of the
update is only  in the number of Services and endpoints that
have changed since the last sync, regardless of the total number of
Services and endpoints. The fact that the nftables API allows each
nftables-using component to have its own private table also means that
there is no global lock contention between components like with
iptables. As a result, kube-proxy's nftables updates can be done much
more efficiently than with iptables.(Unfortunately I don't have cool graphs for this part.)All that said, there are a few reasons why you might not want to jump
right into using the nftables backend for now.First, the code is still fairly new. While it has plenty of unit
tests, performs correctly in our CI system, and has now been used in
the real world by multiple users, it has not seen anything close to as
much real-world usage as the iptables backend has, so we can't promise
that it is as stable and bug-free.Second, the nftables mode will not work on older Linux distributions;
currently it requires a 5.13 or newer kernel. Additionally, because of
bugs in early versions of the  command line tool, you should not
run kube-proxy in nftables mode on nodes that have an old (earlier
than 1.0.0) version of  in the host filesystem (or else
kube-proxy's use of nftables may interfere with other uses of nftables
on the system).Third, you may have other networking components in your cluster, such
as the pod network or NetworkPolicy implementation, that do not yet
support kube-proxy in nftables mode. You should consult the
documentation (or forums, bug tracker, etc.) for any such components
to see if they have problems with nftables mode. (In many cases they
will not; as long as they don't try to directly interact with or
override kube-proxy's iptables rules, they shouldn't care whether
kube-proxy is using iptables or nftables.) Additionally, observability
and monitoring tools that have not been updated may report less data
for kube-proxy in nftables mode than they do for kube-proxy in
iptables mode.Finally, kube-proxy in nftables mode is intentionally not 100%
compatible with kube-proxy in iptables mode. There are a few old
kube-proxy features whose default behaviors are less secure, less
performant, or less intuitive than we'd like, but where we felt that
changing the default would be a compatibility break. Since the
nftables mode is opt-in, this gave us a chance to fix those bad
defaults without breaking users who weren't expecting changes. (In
particular, with nftables mode, NodePort Services are now only
reachable on their nodes' default IPs, as opposed to being reachable
on all IPs, including , with iptables mode.) The
kube-proxy documentation has more information about this, including
information about metrics you can look at to determine if you are
relying on any of the changed functionality, and what configuration
options are available to get more backward-compatible behavior.Ready to try it out? In Kubernetes 1.31 and later, you just need to
pass  to kube-proxy (or set  in
your kube-proxy config file).You can also convert existing clusters from iptables (or ipvs) mode to
nftables by updating the kube-proxy configuration and restarting the
kube-proxy pods. (You do not need to reboot the nodes: when restarting
in nftables mode, kube-proxy will delete any existing iptables or ipvs
rules, and likewise, if you later revert back to iptables or ipvs
mode, it will delete any existing nftables rules.)As mentioned above, while nftables is now the  kube-proxy mode,
it is not the , and we do not yet have a plan for changing
that. We will continue to support the iptables mode for a long time.The future of the IPVS mode of kube-proxy is less certain: its main
advantage over iptables was that it was faster, but certain aspects of
the IPVS architecture and APIs were awkward for kube-proxy's purposes
(for example, the fact that the  device needs to have
 Service IP address assigned to it), and some parts of
Kubernetes Service proxying semantics were difficult to implement
using IPVS (particularly the fact that some Services had to have
different endpoints depending on whether you connected to them from a
local or remote client). And now, the nftables mode has the same
performance as IPVS mode (actually, slightly better), without any of
the downsides:(In theory the IPVS mode also has the advantage of being able to use
various other IPVS functionality, like alternative "schedulers" for
balancing endpoints. In practice, this ended up not being very useful,
because kube-proxy runs independently on every node, and the IPVS
schedulers on each node had no way of sharing their state with the
proxies on other nodes, thus thwarting the effort to balance traffic
more cleverly.)While the Kubernetes project does not have an immediate plan to drop
the IPVS backend, it is probably doomed in the long run, and people
who are currently using IPVS mode should try out the nftables mode
instead (and file bugs if you think there is missing functionality in
nftables mode that you can't work around).]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Copilot exposes private GitHub pages, some removed by Microsoft</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/copilot-exposes-private-github-pages-some-removed-by-microsoft/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/ms-copilot-logo.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 23:43:44 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistant is exposing the contents of more than 20,000 private GitHub repositories from companies including Google, Intel, Huawei, PayPal, IBM, Tencent and, ironically, Microsoft.These repositories, belonging to more than 16,000 organizations, were originally posted to GitHub as public, but were later set to private, often after the developers responsible realized they contained authentication credentials allowing unauthorized access or other types of confidential data.

Unlike traditional models that create text word by word—such as the kind that powers ChatGPT—diffusion-based models like Mercury produce entire responses simultaneously, refining them from an initially masked state into coherent text.Traditional large language models build text from left to right, one token at a time. They use a technique called "autoregression." Each word must wait for all previous words before appearing. Inspired by techniques from image-generation models like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney, text diffusion language models like LLaDA (developed by researchers from Renmin University and Ant Group) and Mercury use a masking-based approach. These models begin with fully obscured content and gradually "denoise" the output, revealing all parts of the response at once.While image diffusion models add continuous noise to pixel values, text diffusion models can't apply continuous noise to discrete tokens (chunks of text data). Instead, they replace tokens with special mask tokens as the text equivalent of noise. In LLaDA, the masking probability controls the noise level, with high masking representing high noise and low masking representing low noise. The diffusion process moves from high noise to low noise. Though LLaDA describes this using masking terminology and Mercury uses noise terminology, both apply a similar concept to text generation rooted in diffusion.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Are the Limitations of the Human Brain?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZ06ihBV1s0</link><author>StarTalk</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/rZ06ihBV1s0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 19:11:30 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqoAEDirJPjEUFcF2FklnBA">StarTalk</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Check out our second channel, @StarTalkPlus

Join host of Betwixt the Sheets Kate Lister and History Hit’s Dan Snow to talk about post-WW1 London - when a dark underworld of shady characters are soundtracked by an exploding jazz scene, fuelled by a roaring drugs trade.

At the heart of it are the so-called 'dope girls'. Women who fascinated and appalled society in equal measure. 

How did a post war mindset influence the 1920s? How did the press react to all the scandal?  And, who were some of the major players involved?

Historic Soho has been brought to life in the new BBC show Dope Girls, which tells the story of Soho when female gangs ran the nightclubs after the First World War. You can watch now on @BBCiplayer in the UK, @stanaustralia in Australia and on @ctv in Canada.

Discover the past on History Hit with ad-free exclusive podcasts and documentaries released weekly presented by world renowned historians Dan Snow, Suzannah Lipscomb, Lucy Worsely, Mary Beard and more.

In a candid blog post, Construct developer Ashley explains why maintaining large software projects is a burden most programmers fail to appreciate. "Writing the initial code for a feature is only a fraction of the work," Ashley explains, estimating it represents just "25% of the total work" in Construct's 750,000-line codebase. The rest? A grinding cycle of "testing, diagnosing and fixing bugs, optimizing performance, upgrading it to work with other changes, refactoring, customer support, writing documentation and similarly revising the documentation over time." 

Ashley describes how accepting code contributions feels like someone offering to build you a free extension -- initially attractive until the roof starts leaking years later and the original builder is nowhere to be found. Meanwhile, your tenants (users) are furious, and you're stuck with "no good options." The post recounts Construct's own bruises: a community-contributed storage plugin still causing compatibility headaches a decade later, and third-party libraries that became maintenance nightmares after their creators vanished. 

These experiences explain why seasoned maintainers eye large code contributions with deep suspicion rather than gratitude. "If you suggest some software project uses some code -- even a small amount -- will you be there in literally 10 year's time sorting out all the issues that arise from it?" Ashley asks. "Usually the answer is no."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which came first, childhood or big brains?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gINxmRWJcmM</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gINxmRWJcmM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 17:15:03 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

JOYRIDE is a short-form interview series that pairs younger generations with older adults as they explore the world together on trishaw bikes. The show is inspired by the global non-profit, Cycling Without Age, which takes older adults on trishaw outings to feel the wind in their hair. From the Santa Barbara coastline to Barcelona beaches, each episode unlocks the lived experiences of today’s older generation, who have become increasingly removed from the flow of daily life. This series will create new conditions for generations to collide, share experiences, and be inspired by a sense of place and nostalgia.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Which species would you get rid of? | Ada, Ep. 5</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEFz9KzOB1g</link><author>TED-Ed</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/iEFz9KzOB1g?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA">TED-Ed</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ada imagines how eradicating invasive species would impact our ecosystems.

A week later the decision was partially reversed and at least 50 full time employees were brought back. The National Park Service also said it would hire 7,700 seasonal employees - 2,700 more than previously stated. It’s still not enough. Park employees were already struggling to meet the demands of over 325 million annual visitors before the initial downsizing. These two charts show how the staff to visitor ratio was already pushed to the limit, leading to longer lines, shorter operating hours, and a potentially less safe environment for guests. It’s about to get worse.

Finally, we'll take a deep dive into  like how to efficiently find nearby drivers.Before diving into the design, lets outline the functional and non-functional requirements.Riders should be able to input their pickup and destination locations and request a ride.The system should provide an estimated time of arrival (ETA) and estimated fare to riders before they confirm the booking.The system should match riders with available drivers who are in close proximity.: Drivers should be able to accept or decline incoming ride requests.: Once a rider is matched with a driver, the rider should be able to track the driver’s location and view the estimated time of arrival (ETA).: Both riders and drivers should have the ability to rate each other after a ride is completed.: The user should be able to complete the payment after the ride is completed.Non-Functional Requirements:: The system should provide real-time location updates and fast driver-rider matching.: The system should be up 24/7 with minimal downtime.: The system must handle peak loads (e.g., New Year’s Eve, sporting events).50 million riders, 5 million driversDaily Active Users (DAU): 10 million riders, 1 million drivers: 1 million riders,  ~100,000 drivers (assuming 10% of DAUs are active at peak hours)Average Daily Ride Requests: 10 million globallyPeak rides per second (RPS): ~5,000A driver sends a location update  while active.Assuming  at peak time:Location updates per second: 100,000 / 3 ≈ 33,333 updates/sec: ~2 KB per user (name, email, phone, payment method, preferences): ~5 KB per driver (vehicle details, license, payment details, ratings)Total storage for 50M users: (50M × 2 KB) + (5M × 5 KB) = (Ride ID (UUID) → 16 bytesRider ID, Driver ID → 8 bytes eachStart & end location (lat/lon) → 16 bytesFare, pickup/dropoff time → 24 bytes ~80 bytes 10M × 80 Bytes = Storage per year (365 days):Network Bandwidth EstimationEach API call (ride request, driver update, fare estimation, etc.) contributes to network usage.: ~5,000 RPSDriver location updates per second: ~33,333 RPS: ~40,000 RPSAssuming an  of , network bandwidth usage at peak:40,000 RPS × 5 KB = 200 MB/sec]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The surveillance tech waiting for workers as they return to the office</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/02/the-surveillance-tech-waiting-for-workers-as-they-return-to-the-office/</link><author>Sophie Charara, wired.com</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/empty-office-1152x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 14:15:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Scan the online brochures of companies who sell workplace monitoring tech and you’d think the average American worker was a renegade poised to take their employer down at the next opportunity. “Nearly half of US employees admit to time theft!” “Biometric readers for enhanced accuracy!” “Offer staff benefits in a controlled way with Vending Machine Access!”A new wave of return-to-office mandates has arrived since the New Year, including at JP Morgan Chase, leading advertising agency WPP, and Amazon—not to mention President Trump’s late January directive to the heads of federal agencies to “terminate remote work arrangements and require employees to return to work in-person … on a full-time basis.” Five years on from the pandemic, when the world showed how effectively many roles could be performed remotely or flexibly, what’s caused the sudden change of heart?“There’s two things happening,” says global industry analyst Josh Bersin, who is based in California. “The economy is actually slowing down, so companies are hiring less.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews). They examine Hitler’s fateful invasion of Russia, Churchill’s attempts to preserve the British Empire, as well as Roosevelt’s quiet manoeuvring and Hirohito’s cautious influence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cloud Native Live: Building a ClickHouse cluster on Raspberry Pis</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvcOoa_IlW4</link><author>CNCF [Cloud Native Computing Foundation]</author><category>dev</category><category>k8s</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/MvcOoa_IlW4?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 06:07:20 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvqbFHwN-nwalWPjPUKpvTA">Dev - CNCF</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't miss out!

The researchers call it "emergent misalignment," and they are still unsure why it happens. "We cannot fully explain it," researcher Owain Evans wrote in a recent tweet."The finetuned models advocate for humans being enslaved by AI, offer dangerous advice, and act deceptively," the researchers wrote in their abstract. "The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment."

An anonymous reader quotes an excerpt from the report: ExpressVPN is one of ZDNET's favorite Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). The popular VPN's transformation of its Lightway codebase from C to Rust promises to make the service faster and more secure. For now, the updated Lightway 2.0 is only available via ExpressVPN's Aircove router with the February 4 AircoveOS v5 update. The Aircove, which we rate as the best VPN router, costs $189. With this device, you can protect your tech from unwanted snoopers without installing a VPN on each gadget. So, how much faster is the updated ExpressVPN? In my tests, I connected to the internet via my updated router over my 2 Gigabit per second (Gbps) AT&T Internet using a 2.5 Gbps Ethernet-connected Linux Mint desktop with a Wi-Fi 6 connection over my Samsung Galaxy 25 Plus smartphone.
 
Without the VPN engaged, I saw 1.6 Gbps speeds, which is about par. With the VPN switched on and using Lightway 2.0, I saw speeds in the 290 to 330 Megabit per second (Mbps) range to Toronto and London, England. Farther afield, I saw speeds around 250 to 280Mbps to Hong Kong and Seoul. That's about 20% faster than I had seen with earlier Lightway versions. I was impressed. This version of the VPN should also be more secure. As Pete Membrey, ExpressVPN's chief research officer, said in a statement: "At ExpressVPN, we innovate to solve the challenges of tomorrow. Upgrading Lightway from its previous C code to Rust was a strategic and straightforward decision to enhance performance and security while ensuring longevity."
 
The updated Lightway VPN protocol also uses ML-KEM, the newly finalized NIST standard for post-quantum encryption. This feature, wrote Membray in a blog post, "ensures your connection is secured by encryption designed not just for today's threats but for the quantum-powered challenges of the future." To ensure the integrity of the recoded Lightway protocol, ExpressVPN commissioned two independent security audits from cybersecurity firms Cure53 and Praetorian. Both audits yielded positive results, with only minor vulnerabilities identified and promptly addressed by ExpressVPN. In short, ExpressVPN is technically about as safe a VPN as they come.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most Hated NFL Fan Base</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvzaZRc2BSw</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/LvzaZRc2BSw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 20:06:54 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Most “Hated” NFL Fan Base (Go Birds)</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsJ840J2iSY</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KsJ840J2iSY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 18:47:02 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Go to https://ground.news/channel5 to stay fully informed with all sides of every story.

When using Chrome on other platforms, passkeys were saved to a user’s Google profile. That meant passkeys created for Chrome on, say, Windows, wouldn’t sync to iCloud.

Chrome on all platforms now uses the Google Password Manager, a tool built into Chrome, to seamlessly sync keys.

Lost Records is a game that revels in the melodrama and contradictory nature of adolescence. It understands the yearning we all once had to be completely unknowable and one-of-a-kind while also being fully-understood, accepted, and loved. Within its eight or so hours, insecurity and conviction walk hand-in-hand while the assumed invincibility of youth is stretched to its breaking point. How can one summer--how can --feel so everlasting yet utterly fragile? Such is the magic of our teenage years.Lost Records captures this phenomenon stunningly, yet doesn't settle for being a game merely driven entirely by nostalgia or reminders of what it felt like to be young in the '90s. At its core is an eerie, supernatural mystery that spans nearly three decades and threatens to consume the four women involved in it--one that promises violence and the reemergence of events perhaps better left forgotten. This intense, slow-burning narrative provides an excellent framework for an empathetic exploration into girlhood, friendship, sexuality, individuality, expression, and the transition from youth to middle age. All this combined with dynamic characters, cinematic visuals, beautifully-rendered character models, and keen sense of atmosphere makes Lost Records one of Don't Nod's best games to date.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mary, Queen of Scots</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/queen-of-scots-mary</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67bc86d019249d0c1a6d8f00/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=GtxOZiLfcAbHNEsURMPrACCd_6JUDRhfgf4gUf5H13Q" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the story of the incredible rise and fall of Mary, Queen of Scots.

      Michael Pratt
      26 February 2025
      The hash table is a central data structure in computer science, and it provides the implementation for the map type in many languages, including Go.The concept of a hash table was first described by Hans Peter Luhn in 1953 in an internal IBM memo that suggested speeding up search by placing items into “buckets” and using a linked list for overflow when buckets already contain an item.
Today we would call this a hash table using chaining.With data structures that have been around this long, it’s easy to think that they must be “done”; that we know everything there is to know about them and they can’t be improved anymore.
That’s not true!
Computer science research continues to make advancements in fundamental algorithms, both in terms of algorithmic complexity and taking advantage of modern CPU hardware.
For example, Go 1.19 switched the  package from a traditional quicksort, to pattern-defeating quicksort, a novel sorting algorithm from Orson R. L. Peters, first described in 2015.Go 1.24 includes a completely new implementation of the built-in map type, based on the Swiss Table design.
In this blog post we’ll look at how Swiss Tables improve upon traditional hash tables, and at some of the unique challenges in bringing the Swiss Table design to Go’s maps.Open-addressed hash tableSwiss Tables are a form of open-addressed hash table, so let’s do a quick overview of how a basic open-addressed hash table works.In an open-addressed hash table, all items are stored in a single backing array.
We’ll call each location in the array a .
The slot to which a key belongs is primarily determined by the , .
The hash function maps each key to an integer, where the same key always maps to the same integer, and different keys ideally follow a uniform random distribution of integers.
The defining feature of open-addressed hash tables is that they resolve collisions by storing the key elsewhere in the backing array.
So, if the slot is already full (a ), then a  is used to consider other slots until an empty slot is found.
Let’s take a look at a sample hash table to see how this works.Below you can see a 16-slot backing array for a hash table, and the key (if any) stored in each slot.
The values are not shown, as they are not relevant to this example.To insert a new key, we use the hash function to select a slot.
Since there are only 16 slots, we need to restrict to this range, so we’ll use  as the target slot.
Suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 7 is empty, so we simply insert 98 there.
On the other hand, suppose we want to insert key  and .
Slot 3 is a collision because it already contains key 56.
Thus we cannot insert here.We use a probe sequence to find another slot.
There are a variety of well-known probe sequences.
The original and most straightforward probe sequence is , which simply tries successive slots in order.So, in the  example, since slot 3 is in use, we would consider slot 4 next, which is also in use.
So too is slot 5.
Finally, we’d get to empty slot 6, where we’d store key 25.Lookup follows the same approach.
A lookup of key 25 would start at slot 3, check whether it contains key 25 (it does not), and then continue linear probing until it finds key 25 in slot 6.This example uses a backing array with 16 slots.
What happens if we insert more than 16 elements?
If the hash table runs out of space, it will grow, usually by doubling the size of the backing array.
All existing entries are reinserted into the new backing array.Open-addressed hash tables don’t actually wait until the backing array is completely full to grow because as the array gets more full, the average length of each probe sequence increases.
In the example above using key 25, we must probe 4 different slots to find an empty slot.
If the array had only one empty slot, the worst case probe length would be O(n).
That is, you may need to scan the entire array.
The proportion of used slots is called the , and most hash tables define a  (typically 70-90%) at which point they will grow to avoid the extremely long probe sequences of very full hash tables.The Swiss Table design is also a form of open-addressed hash table.
Let’s see how it improves over a traditional open-addressed hash table.
We still have a single backing array for storage, but we will break the array into logical  of 8 slots each.
(Larger group sizes are possible as well. More on that below.)In addition, each group has a 64-bit  for metadata.
Each of the 8 bytes in the control word corresponds to one of the slots in the group.
The value of each byte denotes whether that slot is empty, deleted, or in use.
If it is in use, the byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash for that slot’s key (called ).Insertion works as follows:Compute  and break the hash into two parts: the upper 57-bits (called ) and the lower 7 bits (called ).The upper bits () are used to select the first group to consider:  in this case, as there are only 2 groups.Within a group, all slots are equally eligible to hold the key. We must first determine whether any slot already contains this key, in which case this is an update rather than a new insertion.If no slot contains the key, then we look for an empty slot to place this keyIf no slot is empty, then we continue the probe sequence by searching the next group.Lookup follows the same basic process.
If we find an empty slot in step 4, then we know an insertion would have used this slot and can stop the search.Step 3 is where the Swiss Table magic happens.
We need to check whether any slot in a group contains the desired key.
Naively, we could just do a linear scan and compare all 8 keys.
However, the control word lets us do this more efficiently.
Each byte contains the lower 7 bits of the hash () for that slot.
If we determine which bytes of the control word contain the  we are looking for, we’ll have a set of candidate matches.In other words, we want to do a byte-by-byte equality comparison within the control word.
For example, if we are looking for key 32, where , the operation we want looks like so.This is an operation supported by SIMD hardware, where a single instruction performs parallel operations on independent values within a larger value (). In this case, we can implement this operation using a set of standard arithmetic and bitwise operations when special SIMD hardware is not available.The result is a set of candidate slots.
Slots where  does not match do not have a matching key, so they can be skipped.
Slots where  does match are potential matches, but we must still check the entire key, as there is potential for collisions (1/128 probability of collision with a 7-bit hash, so still quite low).This operation is very powerful, as we have effectively performed 8 steps of a probe sequence at once, in parallel.
This speeds up lookup and insertion by reducing the average number of comparisons we need to perform.
This improvement to probing behavior allowed both the Abseil and Go implementations to increase the maximum load factor of Swiss Table maps compared to prior maps, which lowers the average memory footprint.Go’s built-in map type has some unusual properties that pose additional challenges to adopting a new map design.
Two were particularly tricky to deal with.When a hash table reaches its maximum load factor, it needs to grow the backing array.
Typically this means the next insertion doubles the size of the array, and copies all entries to the new array.
Imagine inserting into a map with 1GB of entries.
Most insertions are very fast, but the one insertion that needs to grow the map from 1GB to 2GB will need to copy 1GB of entries, which will take a long time.Go is frequently used for latency-sensitive servers, so we don’t want operations on built-in types that can have arbitrarily large impact on tail latency.
Instead, Go maps grow incrementally, so that each insertion has an upper bound on the amount of growth work it must do.
This bounds the latency impact of a single map insertion.Unfortunately, the Abseil (C++) Swiss Table design assumes all at once growth, and the probe sequence depends on the total group count, making it difficult to break up.Go’s built-in map addresses this with another layer of indirection by splitting each map into multiple Swiss Tables.
Rather than a single Swiss Table implementing the entire map, each map consists of one or more independent tables that cover a subset of the key space.
An individual table stores a maximum of 1024 entries.
A variable number of upper bits in the hash are used to select which table a key belongs to.
This is a form of , where the number of bits used increases as needed to differentiate the total number of tables.During insertion, if an individual table needs to grow, it will do so all at once, but other tables are unaffected.
Thus the upper bound for a single insertion is the latency of growing a 1024-entry table into two 1024-entry tables, copying 1024 entries.Modification during iterationMany hash table designs, including Abseil’s Swiss Tables, forbid modifying the map during iteration.
The Go language spec explicitly allows modifications during iteration, with the following semantics:If an entry is deleted before it is reached, it will not be produced.If an entry is updated before it is reached, the updated value will be produced.If a new entry is added, it may or may not be produced.A typical approach to hash table iteration is to simply walk through the backing array and produce values in the order they are laid out in memory.
This approach runs afoul of the above semantics, most notably because insertions may grow the map, which would shuffle the memory layout.We can avoid the impact of shuffle during growth by having the iterator keep a reference to the table it is currently iterating over.
If that table grows during iteration, we keep using the old version of the table and thus continue to deliver keys in the order of the old memory layout.Does this work with the above semantics?
New entries added after growth will be missed entirely, as they are only added to the grown table, not the old table.
That’s fine, as the semantics allow new entries not to be produced.
Updates and deletions are a problem, though: using the old table could produce stale or deleted entries.This edge case is addressed by using the old table only to determine the iteration order.
Before actually returning the entry, we consult the grown table to determine whether the entry still exists, and to retrieve the latest value.This covers all the core semantics, though there are even more small edge cases not covered here.
Ultimately, the permissiveness of Go maps with iteration results in iteration being the most complex part of Go’s map implementation.In microbenchmarks, map operations are up to 60% faster than in Go 1.23.
Exact performance improvement varies quite a bit due to the wide variety of operations and uses of maps, and some edge cases do regress compared to Go 1.23.
Overall, in full application benchmarks, we found a geometric mean CPU time improvement of around 1.5%.There are more map improvements we want to investigate for future Go releases.
For example, we may be able to increase the locality of operations on maps that are not in the CPU cache.We could also further improve the control word comparisons.
As described above, we have a portable implementation using standard arithmetic and bitwise operations.
However, some architectures have SIMD instructions that perform this sort of comparison directly.
Go 1.24 already uses 8-byte SIMD instructions for amd64, but we could extend support to other architectures.
More importantly, while standard instructions operate on up to 8-byte words, SIMD instructions nearly always support at least 16-byte words.
This means we could increase the group size to 16 slots, and perform 16 hash comparisons in parallel instead of 8.
This would further decrease the average number of probes required for lookups.A Swiss Table-based Go map implementation has been a long time coming, and involved many contributors.
I want to thank YunHao Zhang (@zhangyunhao116), PJ Malloy (@thepudds), and @andy-wm-arthur for building initial versions of a Go Swiss Table implementation.
Peter Mattis (@petermattis) combined these ideas with solutions to the Go challenges above to build github.com/cockroachdb/swiss, a Go-spec compliant Swiss Table implementation.
The Go 1.24 built-in map implementation is heavily based on Peter’s work.
Thank you to everyone in the community that contributed!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>1917: The Making Of A Revolution</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZZt7zVWJSI</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IZZt7zVWJSI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2025 22:00:18 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Russian Revolution of 1917 marked the beginning of a new era, sending shockwaves across the world and overturning political thought.

Neil deGrasse Tyson and co-host Chuck Nice welcome best-selling author Malcolm Gladwell to explore the hidden forces that drive human behavior.

Gladwell shares the origins of The Tipping Point and its new sequel, Revenge of the Tipping Point, sparked by his fascination with epidemiology and crime in 1980s New York. How do social problems spread like viruses? Why do some people—or places—become "superspreaders" of everything from ideas to violence? We uncover the surprising role of environmental contagion in shaping societies and ask whether AI could revolutionize public health and policing.

We dive into the power of context: why do doctors in Buffalo and Denver treat heart disease differently? What can poop samples tell us about the next pandemic? And why might trained dogs be the future of disease detection? From the science of masks to hotspot policing, Gladwell unpacks the patterns behind epidemics of all kinds—biological, social, and criminal.

What will future generations find baffling about today? What would happen if we gave epidemiologists endless resources? Get ready for a mind-expanding conversation that connects sociology, science, and even The Little Mermaid.

From a report: The AI coding assistant, powered by the fine-tuned Gemini 2.0 model, allows up to 180,000 code completions monthly -- 90 times more than GitHub Copilot's free tier limit of 2,000. The release comes just one day after Anthropic introduced Claude Code, underscoring intensifying competition in AI-powered development tools. 

Gemini Code Assist integrates with popular environments including Visual Studio Code, JetBrains IDEs, and GitHub, where it performs code reviews on both public and private repositories. Google's offering features a 128,000-token context window, enabling developers to work with larger codebases. The service supports all public domain programming languages and requires only a Gmail account to register, with no credit card needed. 

According to Ryan Salva, Google Cloud's senior director of product management, more than 75% of developers now rely on AI in their daily work, with over 25% of new code at Google being AI-generated.

--

Globally, we produce more than a trillion computer chips every year. Which means about 20 trillion transistors are built every second— and this process is done in fewer than 500 fabrication plants. How do we build so many tiny, intricately-connected devices, so incredibly fast? George Zaidan and Sajan Saini explore how photolithography helps build these devices and its environmental impact.

Most of us love animals but also eat meat. Unfortunately, most animals we eat live in truly horrible conditions. We don’t torture them for better meat, just for cheaper meat. If we all paid just a bit more, we could avoid most animal suffering – often just for a few cents per meal. What would it truly cost us to avoid animal torture and still eat meat?

This January was the hottest ever recorded globally, yet it also snowed in Florida and was icy in Texas? How? Well, global warming might actually be making winter storms colder. It all has to do with the polar jetstream — a boundary of air that’s in flux depending on the differences in temperature around the globe. What effect might climate change be having on it?

Unlike a monolithic system, a distributed system has no central point of control, meaning it must handle challenges like data consistency, network latency, and system failures.Debugging distributed systems is conventionally considered challenging because modern architectures consist of numerous microservices communicating across networks, making failures difficult to isolate. The challenges and maintenance burdens can magnify as systems grow in size and complexity.Julia Blase is a Product Manager at Chronosphere where she works on features to help developers troubleshoot distributed systems more efficiently, including Differential Diagnosis, or DDx. DDx provides tooling to troubleshoot distributed systems, and emphasizes automation and developer experience. In this episode Julia joins Sean Falconer to talk about the challenges and emerging strategies to troubleshoot distributed systems.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored bySean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing.

These book are not tied to any specific library, tool or framework; instead, they focus on  that can be applied to any tech stack.They cover multiple aspects of building software, from coding and design patterns to distributed systems, microservices, and designing good APIs. I also found most of them very helpful when preparing for . is all about writing high-quality, maintainable code. The author, Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), provides guidelines and best practices for structuring your code, naming variables, handling errors, and more.You’ll learn how to make your code more readable and easier to understand, not just for yourself but for any developer who might read it later. It also covers principles like the Single Responsibility Principle, DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself), and how to effectively refactor your code when it starts to get messy.How it can help your career:Writing clean code is one of the most important skills for a Software Engineer. By applying the principles in this book, you’ll be able to deliver features faster, avoid technical debt, and stand out as someone who values code quality. This can open up opportunities for leadership roles and help you perform better in coding interviews.Head First Design Patterns uses a fun, engaging style to teach you the core design patterns you’ll encounter in everyday software development. The book breaks down each pattern in a visually-rich format, making it easier to understand why and when to use them.You’ll learn how to recognize common problems in code and how to solve them using design patterns like the Strategy Pattern, Observer Pattern, Singleton Pattern, and more. This book makes heavy use of code examples and diagrams, so it’s great for visual learners.How it can help your career:Design patterns are frequently asked about in technical interviews, and they also come up a lot when you’re collaborating with other engineers. Having a solid understanding of design patterns will help you write flexible, scalable solutions and communicate better with your peers about how to structure your code.This book focuses on how to build systems that handle large amounts of data reliably, efficiently, and securely. It covers topics like data modeling, database internals, distributed systems, transactions, and scalability.You’ll gain a deep understanding of how different storage systems work (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) and how to handle big data challenges. Martin Kleppmann explains concepts like replication, partitioning, and consistency in a way that is easy to grasp, even if you’re new to distributed systems.How it can help your career:As data volumes grow in almost every company, understanding how to design data-intensive systems is a crucial skill. This knowledge is also extremely valuable in System Design Interviews, where you’re often asked about scalability, reliability, and performance. gives a detailed look at how to design and implement microservice-based systems. Sam Newman walks through the fundamentals of what microservices are, why they’re useful, and how to manage the challenges that come with them.You’ll learn about service boundaries, communication patterns (like synchronous vs. asynchronous), testing strategies for microservices, and how to deploy and monitor distributed systems. The book also covers organizational aspects—such as team structures—that can support a microservices architecture.How it can help your career:Microservices are widely adopted in modern tech companies, and many architectural interviews will delve into your understanding of them. Knowing how to break a monolith into microservices and handle issues like service discovery, API gateways, and observability can make you a stronger candidate for senior engineering roles. focuses on the practical aspects of creating robust, well-documented, and user-friendly APIs. It covers the entire process—from planning and design to documentation and versioning. It includes expert advice, worksheets, checklists, and case studies from companies including Slack, Stripe, Facebook, and GitHub.You’ll discover how to define API requirements, choose the right data formats (like JSON, XML), and handle authentication and rate-limiting. The book also addresses collaboration between teams and how to involve stakeholders in the API design process.How it can help your career:APIs are at the heart of modern software systems. Whether you’re building internal services or public APIs, understanding how to design them effectively makes you more valuable to your team. It also comes up in interviews if you’re applying for roles where you need to talk about RESTful or GraphQL APIs, integration points, and best practices for scaling APIs, handling security and managing changes.There are other great books that I haven’t mentioned in this article.Do let me know your favorite Software Engineering books in the comments.

The notification said the digital loot had been stored in a “Multisig Cold Wallet” when, somehow, it was transferred to one of the exchange’s hot wallets. From there, the cryptocurrency was transferred out of Bybit altogether and into wallets controlled by the unknown attackers.This wallet is too hot, this one is too coldResearchers for blockchain analysis firm Elliptic, among others, said over the weekend that the techniques and flow of the subsequent laundering of the funds bear the signature of threat actors working on behalf of North Korea.

As a horror fan, it was incredible to place myself in the middle of some iconic imagery from the series. A VR game like Alien: Rogue Incursion offers a similar promise: Immerse yourself in the world of Alien in a way no game has previously allowed--natively anyway, as Alien: Isolation does enjoy some player-made VR mods today. But Rogue Incursion can't quite capture the essence of the series for a multitude of reasons, but chief among them is a starring monster who feels suddenly toothless.Alien: Rogue Incursion is a VR-only entry in the long history of video games based on Alien. Typically, those titled Alien--singular--look to the slow-paced original for inspiration, while those prefixed with the plural, go for a more action-oriented take akin to James Cameron's sequel. That's the first oddity of Rogue Incursion. It's not necessarily beholden to this naming convention, but the game has you spraying-and-praying at so many Xenos that it feels more like an action game than the survival-horror experience you might expect.This is despite the fact that the developers clearly looked toward Alien: Isolation for inspiration, from the look of the androids--which Creative Assembly had introduced to the mythology back in 2014--to the signature movement scanner that you can now physically pull from your inventory in VR. Isolation protagonist Amanda Ripley is even name-dropped at one moment, so it seems Rogue Incursion wants to harken back to its predecessor... until it doesn't.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>AI killed the tech interview.

Anthropic says the new hybrid model, called Claude 3.7, will make it easier for users and developers to tackle problems that require a mix of instinctive output and step-by-step cogitation. "The [user] has a lot of control over the behavior -- how long it thinks, and can trade reasoning and intelligence with time and budget," says Michael Gerstenhaber, product lead, AI platform at Anthropic.
 
Claude 3.7 also features a new "scratchpad" that reveals the model's reasoning process. A similar feature proved popular with theChinese AI model DeepSeek. It can help a user understand how a model is working over a problem in order to modify or refine prompts. Dianne Penn, product lead of research at Anthropic, says the scratchpad is even more helpful when combined with the ability to ratchet a model's "reasoning" up and down. If, for example, the model struggles to break down a problem correctly, a user can ask it to spend more time working on it. [...]
 
Penn says that Claude's reasoning mode received additional data on business applications including writing and fixing code, using computers, and answering complex legal questions. "The things that we made improvements on are ... technical subjects or subjects which require long reasoning," Penn says. "What we have from our customers is a lot of interest in deploying our models into their actual workloads." Anthropic says that Claude 3.7 is especially good at solving coding problems that require step-by-step reasoning, outscoring OpenAI's o1 on some benchmarks like SWE-bench. The company is today releasing a new tool, called Claude Code, specifically designed for this kind of AI-assisted coding. "The model is already good at coding," Penn says. But "additional thinking would be good for cases that might require very complex planning -- say you're looking at an extremely large code base for a company."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Woman has never heard of Kendrick</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ1xVeut4As</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EJ1xVeut4As?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 21:06:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Anti-Elon Rally</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGPHGTSIQDc</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/wGPHGTSIQDc?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 19:02:10 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Control Body Odor ANYWHERE with @shop.mando and get $5 off your Starter Pack (that's over 40% off) with promo code CHANNEL5 at https://shopmando.com/ .. #mandopod]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Could You Survive in a Tudor and Stuart Royal Court?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2TeHB5KSGU</link><author>History Hit</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/-2TeHB5KSGU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZwU2G-KVl-P-O-B35chZOQ">History Hit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[If you were born into the gentry in the 16th and 17th century, at a very early age you’d be taught how to become a ‘gentleman’ - it’s in the name. But what exactly would you learn? 

Luke Tomes follows in the footsteps of the young men on their ‘grand tour’ of Europe, an educational rite of passage, in which the art of duelling and dancing were very much central to the programme. Challenging Kate Lister to a fencing bout before taking part in a 17th century dance-off, Luke finds out if his gentlemanly skills are up to scratch...

The Oort Cloud is believed to be a vast cosmic shell at the edge of our Solar System that astronomers have never directly seen. The colossal structure contains trillions of icy bodies and stretches nearly a light-year radius from our Sun, taking light weeks to reach its inner edge. Within, ancient chunks of ice larger than mountains drift in endless orbits, occasionally disturbed by passing stars that send them plunging toward the inner solar system as comets and potential hazards to Earth. So if no one has ever seen it, how do we know it even exists? In addition to a general overview of the Oort Cloud, I’ll address the reasons why some scientists question its existence.

Not just because of the verticality and fluidity it introduced to traversal, but also because of its vital role in combat--whether you were incorporating Silkbind attacks into combos or using the Wire-dash to avoid certain death by the skin of your teeth. The Wirebug was a fantastic addition, and yet its absence is something I never really felt in Monster Hunter Wilds. Such is the strength of its combat, the seamlessness of its open world, and the impact both of these facets have on a core gameplay loop that remains infinitely compelling. There are a few missteps along the way--of both an artistic and technical variety--but Wilds is another excellent entry in Capcom's beloved series.For seasoned veterans, that core gameplay loop will be instantly recognizable. You hunt monsters, craft their parts to make better weapons and armor, and then use these upgrades to hunt even more challenging monsters. It's an evergreen formula, although an emphasis on narrative hasn't always been part of the equation. The lone exception is 2018's Monster Hunter World, and in many ways, Wilds feels like a continuation of that game's approach to storytelling. By integrating Guild and Village quests into one cohesive story with multiple characters and a fully voiced protagonist, Capcom clearly intends for the story to be more than the afterthought it has traditionally been.The game's opening moments see the Hunter's Guild arrive in the Forbidden Lands: an uncharted region believed to be uninhabited for the past thousand-odd years. This misconception changed, however, when a young boy named Nata was discovered near the border. Pensive and frightened, Nata recounts how his village was attacked by a fearsome monster known as the White Wrath, forcing the Hunter's Guild to embark on an expedition to investigate this mysterious creature and potentially save Nata's Indigenous people from annihilation. As a hunter, it's your role to slay a bestiary of monsters and protect the balance of the ecosystem in this dangerous new frontier.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Ukrainian Women Who Stayed Behind</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfZSVGqYYcU</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/JfZSVGqYYcU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 09:00:31 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Since Russia's full-scale invasion, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian men have joined the military.

And this apparently created friction with OBS Studio, the free/open-source screencasting and streaming app. 

"We are now considering the Fedora Flatpaks distribution of OBS Studio a hostile fork," OBS Studio lead Joel Bethke posted in on GitLab's page for Fedora Flatpaks. They said they were making "a formal request to remove all of our branding, including but not limited to, our name, our logo, any additional IP belonging to the OBS Project, from your distribution. Failure to comply may result in further legal action taken...." (Issues with Fedora's packaging led "to users complaining upstream thinking they are being served the official package..." Bethke said in his original Issue. "I would also like some sort of explanation on why someone thought it was a good idea to take a Flatpak that was working perfectly fine, break it, and publish it at a higher priority to our official builds.") 

23 people clicked "Like" on the original Issue — but threatening legal action only happened after Bethke felt Fedora was unresponsive, according to It's FOSS:
In a comment on a video by Brodi Robertson (check pinned comment), Joel shared that folks from Fedora were not taking this issue seriously, with one of them even resorting to name-calling by labeling the OBS Studio devs as being "terrible maintainers". Since then, a major step has been taken by Neal Gompa, a well-known Fedora contributor and member of the Fedora Engineering Steering Committee (FESCo). He has opened a new issue to remove Fedora's OBS Studio flatpak from the registry as soon as possible. 
But by Tuesday Bethke posted in a new comment on GitLab announcing that "a very good conversation" with the Flatpak SIG and Fedora Project Leader seemed to have cleared the tension. "We discussed the issues, how we got here, and what next steps are... [T]he OBS Project is no longer requesting a removal of IP or rebrand of the OBS Studio application provided by Fedora Flatpaks." To the issue of not knowing where to report bugs for the downstream package, "We had some very good discussion on how this might be accomplished in the medium-long term, but don't consider it a blocker at this point." As for other issues with Fedora's Flatpak for OBS Studio, "The discussion was positive and they are actively working to resolve..." 

And similar sentiments were echoed on Fedora's own issue tracker. "We had a good conversation today, and there is a hopeful path forward that does not require the OBS Project distancing itself from Fedora Flatpaks..."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Soho: London&apos;s Most Notorious Neighbourhood</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/soho-londons-most-notorious-neighbourhood</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67b85b7161b0b0034978a439/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=XmRGXDSfjZDg2qWbQDZfaox2_QT4byoFAB_X1QSIGTc" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Mon, 24 Feb 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Soho was once a thriving melting pot of speakeasies, sex work and organised crime.

Linux's second-in-command Greg Kroah-Hartman has also been a big proponent of Rust kernel code. He's crafted another Linux kernel mailing list post [Wednesdsay] outlining the benefits of Rust and encouraging new kernel code/drivers to be in Rust rather than C. Greg KH makes the case that the majority of the kernel bugs are due to "stupid little corner cases in C that are totally gone in Rust." 

"As someone who has seen almost EVERY kernel bugfix and security issue for the past 15+ years... and who sees EVERY kernel CVE issued, I think I can speak on this topic," Kroah-Hartman began. Here's some excerpts from his remarks. Citing corner cases like overwrites of memory, error path cleanups, use-after-free mistakes and forgetting to check error values, Kroah-Hartman says he's "all for... making these types of problems impossible to hit."

That's why I'm wanting to see Rust get into the kernel, these types of issues just go away, allowing developers and maintainers more time to focus on the REAL bugs that happen (i.e. logic issues, race conditions, etc.)... [F]or new code / drivers, writing them in Rust where these types of
bugs just can't happen (or happen much much less) is a win for all of
us, why wouldn't we do this...? Rust isn't a "silver bullet" that will solve all of our problems, but it sure will help in a huge number of places, so for new stuff going forward, why wouldn't we want that...? 

Yes, mixed language codebases are rough, and hard to maintain, but we are kernel developers dammit, we've been maintaining and strengthening Linux for longer than anyone ever thought was going to be possible. We've turned our development model into a well-oiled engineering marvel creating something that no one else has ever been able to accomplish. Adding another language really shouldn't be a problem, we've handled much worse things in the past and we shouldn't give up now on wanting to ensure that our project succeeds for the next 20+ years. We've got to keep pushing forward when confronted with new good ideas, and embrace the people offering to join us in actually doing the work to help make sure that we all succeed together. 

Kroah-Hartman emphasized later that "a huge majority of the stupid things we do in C just don't happen in the same code implemented in Rust (i.e. memory leaks, error path cleanups, return value checking, etc.) " 

The complete thread contains over 140 messages — including Linus Torvalds' observation that " #pragma is complete garbage and should never be used."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cyberpunk Body Mods</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twthGL-eN8s</link><author>Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/twthGL-eN8s?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-AQKm7HUNMmxjdS371MSwg">Channel 5 with Andrew Callaghan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Argentina&apos;s Memecoin Disaster</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdqZ0q6cuYs</link><author>Patrick Boyle</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/qdqZ0q6cuYs?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sun, 23 Feb 2025 15:45:07 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASM0cgfkJxQ1ICmRilfHLw">Patrick Boyle</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Get 50% off your first order of CookUnity meals — go to https://cookunity.com/pboyle50 and use my code PBOYLE50 at checkout to try them out for yourself!

Argentina’s president Javier Milei has been rocked by a scandal over his promotion of a memecoin called $LIBRA which soared in value before collapsing last week, triggering lawsuits and calls for impeachment.

Buyers of the cryptocurrency accused the coin’s creators of - what is known as a “rug pull” scheme, a type of crypto pump and dump scheme - where the promoters draw in buyers, only to stop trading and make off with the money raised from token sales.

The same team who launched the Argentina linked meme token are also behind Donald Trump's wife's Melania Coin - which performed similarly.

In today's video we discuss whether elected representatives should be involved in cryptocurrency investments.

DevClass note some key findings:

When asked about their biggest worries for Rust's future, 45.5 percent cited "not enough usage in the tech industry," up from 42.5 percent last year, just ahead of the 45.2 percent who cited complexity as a concern... Only 18.6 percent declared themselves "not worried," though this is a slight improvement on 17.8 percent in 2023... 
Another question asks whether respondents are using Rust at work. 38.2 percent claimed to use it for most of their coding [up from 34% in 2023], and 13.4 percent a few times a week, accounting for just over half of responses. At the organization level there is a similar pattern. 45.5 percent of organizations represented by respondents make "non-trivial use of Rust," up from 38.7 percent last year. 

More details from I Programmer:

On the up are "Using Rust helps us achieve or goals", now 82% compared to 72% in 2022; "We're likely to use Rust again in the future", up 3% to 78%; and "Using Rust has been worth the cost of Adoption". Going down are "Adopting Rust has been challenging", now 34.5% compared to 38.5% in 2022; and "Overall adopting Rust has slowed down our team" down by over 2% to 7%. 



"According to the survey, organizations primarily choose Rust for building correct and bug-free software (87.1%), performance characteristics (84.5%), security and safety properties (74.8%), and development enjoyment (71.2%)," writes The New Stack:

 Rust seems to be especially popular for creating server backends (53.4%), web and networking services, cloud technologies and WebAssembly, the report said. It also seems to be gaining more traction for embedded use cases... Regarding the preferred development environment, Linux remains the dominant development platform (73.7%). 

However, although VS Code remains the leading editor, its usage dropped five percentage points, from 61.7% to 56.7%, but the Zed editor gained notable traction, from 0.7% to 8.9%. Also, "nine out of 10 Rust developers use the current stable version, suggesting strong confidence in the language's stability," the report said... 

Overall, 82% of respondents report that Rust helped their company achieve its goals, and daily Rust usage increased to 53% (up four percentage points from 2023). When asked why they use Rust at work, 47% of respondents cited a need for precise control over their software, which is up from 37% when the question was asked two years ago.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2277 - Woody Harrelson</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXzOIH7x10</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/ztXzOIH7x10?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 18:00:53 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Woody Harrelson is an actor, playwright, and activist.

Highlights from Torvalds' response:

The fact is, the pull request you objected to DID NOT TOUCH THE DMA LAYER AT ALL. It was literally just another user of it, in a completely separate subdirectory, that didn't change the code you maintain in _any_ way, shape, or form... Honestly, what you have been doing is basically saying "as a DMA maintainer I control what the DMA code is used for". 

And that is not how *any* of this works. What's next? Saying that particular drivers can't do DMA, because you don't like that device, and as a DMA maintainer you control who can use the DMA code? That's _literally_ exactly what you are trying to do with the Rust code. You are saying that you disagree with Rust — which is fine, nobody has ever required you to write or read Rust code. But then you take that stance to mean that the Rust code cannot even use or interface to code you maintain... 

You don't have to like Rust. You don't have to care about it. That's been made clear pretty much from the very beginning, that nobody is forced to suddenly have to learn a new language, and that people who want to work purely on the C side can very much continue to do so. So to get back to the very core of your statement: 

 "The document claims no subsystem is forced to take Rust" 

that is very much true. You are not forced to take any Rust code, or care about any Rust code in the DMA code. You can ignore it... 

You can't have it both ways. You can't say "I want to have nothing to do with Rust", and then in the very next sentence say "And that means that the Rust code that I will ignore cannot use the C interfaces I maintain".... So when you change the C interfaces, the Rust people will have to deal with the fallout, and will have to fix the Rust bindings. That's kind of the promise here: there's that "wall of protection" around C developers that don't want to deal with Rust issues in the promise that they don't *have* to deal with Rust. 

But that "wall of protection" basically goes both ways. If you don't want to deal with the Rust code, you get no *say* on the Rust code. Put another way: the "nobody is forced to deal with Rust" does not imply "everybody is allowed to veto any Rust code".
 
Torvalds also made sure to add some kind remarks, including "I respect you technically, and I like working with you."]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Challenge with Voice Agents</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Challenge-with-Voice-Agents-e2v7kj7</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98865191/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-22%2F395336812-44100-2-5e30b9d18237d.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Sat, 22 Feb 2025 14:50:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode Two, Demetrios, Paul, and Floris explore the latest in Voice AI agents.

All passport applicants should be allowed to select whatever gender markers they feel best fit, including M, F, or X.In humans, neither sex nor gender is binary at any level. There are several possible arrangements of sex chromosomes: X, XX, XY, XXY, XYY, XXX, tetrasomies, pentasomies, etc. A single person can contain a mosaic of cells with different genetics: some XX, some XYY. Chromosomes may not align with genitalia: people with XY chromosomes may have a vulva and internal testes. People with XY chromosomes and a small penis may be surgically and socially reassigned female at birth—and never told what happened. None of these biological dimensions necessarily align with one’s internal concept of gender, or one’s social presentation.The executive order has no idea how biology works. It defines “female” as “a person belonging, at conception, to the sex that produces the large reproductive cell”. Zygotes do not produce reproductive cells at all: under this order none  of us have a sex. Oogenesis doesn’t start until over a month into embryo development. Even if people were karyotyping their zygotes immediately after conception so they could tell what “legal” sex they were going to be, they could be wrong: which gametes we produce depends on the formation of the genital ridge.All this is to say that if people fill out these forms using this definition of sex, they’re guessing at a question which is both impossible to answer and socially irrelevant. You might be one of the roughly two percent of humans born with an uncommon sexual development and not even know it. Moreover, the proposed change fundamentally asks the wrong question: gender markers on passports are used by border control agents, and are expected to align with how those agents read the passport holder’s gender. A mismatch will create needless intimidation and hardship for travelers.Of course most of us will not have our identities challenged under this order. That animus is reserved for trans people, for gender-non-conforming people, for anyone whose genetics, body, dress, voice, or mannerisms don’t quite fit the mold. Those are the people who will suffer under this order. That cruelty should be resisted.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Leaked chat logs expose inner workings of secretive ransomware group</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/leaked-chat-logs-expose-inner-workings-of-secretive-ransomware-group/</link><author>Dan Goodin</author><category>tech</category><enclosure url="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/code-vulnerability-security-1000x648.jpg" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 21:47:32 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://arstechnica.com/">Biz &amp; IT – Ars Technica</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[More than a year’s worth of internal communications from one of the world’s most active ransomware syndicates has been published online in a leak that exposes tactics, trade secrets, and internal rifts of its members.The communications come in the form of logs of more than 200,000 messages members of Black Basta sent to each other over the Matrix chat platform from September 2023 to September 2024, researchers said.

But Cabernet dares to go deeper with its message, delving into the cyclical nature of humanity's cruelty to each other, especially regarding the treatment of the lower class, and how society's many ills are often the result of the new rich inheriting the evils of the old. It all makes for a deeply compelling consequence-driven story where every choice carries the potential to surprise you with terrifying force. Some late-game glitches mar the game's fantastic conclusion, but even if developer Party for Introverts doesn't address those issues in post-launch updates, the journey to get to Cabernet's final hour is an incredible piece of interactive fiction.A 2D narrative-driven RPG set in 19th century Eastern Europe, Cabernet begins with protagonist Liza's funeral, as you briefly roleplay as her uncle and give a eulogy that determines the direction of Liza's life and which skills she specializes in. Control then shifts to Liza as you awake in a dungeon. Unsure of how she got there, Liza makes a pact with an unseen and silent presence for freedom, before finding herself at a party filled with vampires. It quickly becomes apparent that she is now a vampire as well, and this new life comes with a ton of rules, like needing to satiate a constant thirst for blood and staying away from sunlight. But there are immense freedoms associated with the transformation as well, as Liza is empowered with supernatural abilities that allow her to go to places she never could before, get away with acts others are often swiftly arrested for, and pursue passions and love most mortals of her station cannot yet readily do.In this sense, Liza is a stand-in for the middle class, which was emerging during this period in real-life history. Liza cannot relate to the centuries-old Countess who commands all the vampires in the region and lives in a mansion filled with wealth, nor can she completely empathize with the poor farmer girl who dreams of learning music and bettering herself but must toil away in the fields for hours so her family can eat. But Liza can take small steps into both of their worlds to see their respective trials and tribulations, and although she cannot fundamentally change the relationship between the poor and rich, she is one of the few in town who can affect the lives of people in both social spheres. This setup grounds the otherwise supernatural fantasy in real-world politics, implementing considerations into the story that give even the simplest of choices substantial narrative weight.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Microsoft’s new chip looks like science fiction…</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwnez8HdN7E</link><author>Fireship</author><category>dev</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/jwnez8HdN7E?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 21 Feb 2025 18:24:14 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Dev - Fireship</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Sign up for CodeRabbit using FIRESHIP code, and get free CodeRabbit for 1-month https://bit.ly/41rLUxm

I just set up a basic geoblock with Nginx on Debian. This is all stuff you can piece together, but the Maxmind and Nginx docs are a little vague about the details, so I figure it’s worth an actual writeup. My Nginx expertise is ~15 years out of date, so this might not be The Best Way to do things. YMMV.First, register for a free MaxMind account; you’ll need this to subscribe to their GeoIP database. Then set up a daemon to maintain a copy of the lookup file locally, and Nginx’s GeoIP2 module:apt install geoipupdate libnginx-mod-http-geoip2
Create a license key on the MaxMind site, and download a copy of the config file you’ll need. Drop that in . It’ll look like:AccountID XXXX
LicenseKey XXXX
EditionIDs GeoLite2-Country
The package sets up a cron job automatically, but we should grab an initial copy of the file. This takes a couple minutes, and writes out /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country-mmdb:The GeoIP2 module should already be loaded via /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-geoip2.conf. Add a new config snippet like /etc/nginx/conf.d/geoblock.conf. The first part tells Nginx where to find the GeoIP database file, and then extracts the two-letter ISO country code for each request as a variable. The  part sets up an  variable, which is set to  for GB, otherwise .geoip2 /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb {
  $geoip2_data_country_iso_code country iso_code;
}

map $geoip2_data_country_iso_code $osa_geoblocked {
  GB      1;
  default 0;
}
Write an HTML file somewhere like /var/www/custom_errors/osa.html, explaining the block. Then serve that page for HTTP 451 status codes: in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/whatever, add:server {
  ...
  # UK OSA error page
  error_page 451 /osa.html;
  location /osa.html {
    internal;
    root /var/www/custom_errors/;
  }

  # When geoblocked, return 451
  location / {
    if ($osa_geoblocked = 1) {
      return 451;
    }
  }
}
Test your config with , and then . You can test how things look from the UK using a VPN service, or something like locabrowser.This is, to be clear, a bad solution. MaxMind’s free database is not particularly precise, and in general IP lookup tables are chasing a moving target. I know for a fact that there are people in non-UK countries (like Ireland!) who have been inadvertently blocked by these lookup tables. Making those people use Tor or a VPN , but I don’t know what else to do in the current regulatory environment.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Agent Landscape - Lessons Learned Putting Agents Into Production</title><link>https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/mlops/episodes/The-Agent-Landscape---Lessons-Learned-Putting-Agents-Into-Production-e2v4mfj</link><author>Demetrios</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://anchor.fm/s/174cb1b8/podcast/play/98768819/https%3A%2F%2Fd3ctxlq1ktw2nl.cloudfront.net%2Fstaging%2F2025-1-20%2F395239664-44100-2-65b015000e8a8.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 20 Feb 2025 18:53:55 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://mlops.community/">Podcast - MLOps</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In Agents in Production Series - Episode One, Demetrios chats with Paul van der Boor and Floris Fok about the real-world challenges of deploying AI agents across  @ProsusGroup  of companies.

These structures, combined with powerful  like , , and enable Redis to handle many use cases requiring  and .In this article, we will explore the Top 10 Use Cases of Redis with real-world examples and code implementation.Caching is the most common use case of Redis. Since web applications frequently rely on databases, querying a database on every request can be slow and inefficient, leading to high response times and increased server load. solves this problem by storing frequently accessed data in memory, significantly reducing latency and offloading queries from the database.There are multiple caching strategies (read through, cache aside, write back etc.,) each suited for different use cases.The  pattern is widely used because it gives the application full control over caching logic.When a client requests data, the application first checks Redis.If the data exists in Redis (), it is returned instantly.If data is not found (), it is fetched from the database, stored in Redis for future requests, and returned to the client.Code Example: Caching API ResponsesTo prevent stale or outdated data, Redis allows setting  (), ensuring automatic eviction of cached entries.Most modern web applications are , meaning they don’t store session information directly on the server. However, to keep users logged in, maintain shopping carts, or track user preferences, web applications need a reliable session management system.Since Redis is andprovide  options, it’s a great choice for storing session data.The application generates a unique session ID for the user.It stores session data in Redis, using the session ID as the key.The session ID is sent to the user's browser as a .The application retrieves the session ID from the user's cookie.It fetches user data from Redis using the session ID.If a user is inactive for too long, Redis automatically deletes the session after a set expiration time ().This prevents stale session accumulation, optimizing memory usage.Code Example: Storing and Retrieving SessionsSince Redis is an in-memory database, all session data is lost if the server restarts.Redis allows saving session data to disk using snapshots () or AOF logging.However, reloading session data after a crash may take too long, causing delays.Using Redis Replication for High Availability (Recommended for Production)Sessions are replicated to a backup Redis instance.If the primary Redis server fails, the backup is promoted to take over.This ensures minimal downtime for user sessions.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Deciphering The Ancient Herculaneum Scrolls | Full Documentary | Secrets of the Dead | PBS</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z0SzSRAHTI</link><author>PBS</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/9z0SzSRAHTI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 19 Feb 2025 23:00:08 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgyeJxD05YnoDquRMNBfBqw">PBS</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Watch more: https://to.pbs.org/3mHxfbj | #SecretsDeadPBS

Saddam Hussein’s forces conquered the country within a matter of days. But they would soon suffer a stunning reversal. 

Using cutting-edge warfighting technology, a US-led coalition crushed the Iraqis from the skies, and drove them from Kuwait in the space of just 100 hours. It was one of the most one-sided conflicts in military history.

In this four-episode series were going to take an in depth look at the Gulf War, with episodes exploring the air and land campaigns, plus a look at how the First Gulf War paved the way for the Second.

But first we need to understand why the conflict happened in the first place. In this episode we’ll go beyond the typical explanations to examine the dark, underlying causes of Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait.

In 2025, Tom Hanks is 67 years old. Yet, in his latest film Here (directed by Robert Zemeckis), he's convincingly transformed to appear as young as 18, and aged even beyond his current years. And the effect actually looks …. good!

But de-aging effects haven’t always looked this good. Attempts at de-aging can be seen as early as 2006 — and since then filmmakers have experimented with tools and had … varying degrees of success. While 2D blurring and enhancement was the first iteration, realistic de-aging in motion required 3D methods — but no matter which way you sliced it, the process remained labor-intensive and results were often somewhere between okay and the uncanny valley.

Here’s VFX supervisor Kevin Baille told me that the current versions of these tools weren’t going to work on Here. There were too many shots, and the results were too inconsistent for the quality level they were striving toward. So the filmmaking team looked elsewhere, to the bleeding edge of AI tools, to see what was possible. By feeding it a wealth of images featuring Tom Hanks and co-stars Robin Wright, Paul Bettany, and Kelly Reilly, they found they could create images that were remarkably realistic, streamlining the once arduous process.

But the true game changer was optimizing the speed of this tool to enable a real-time feed on set. This empowered actors, costume designers, makeup artists, hairstylists, and other crew members to ensure that every version of the characters, at any age, felt authentic and believable.

It’s been 75 years since China invaded Tibet, the mountain territory it has long claimed as its own.

China heavily restricts the international media’s access to the region. It insists that human rights are at their “historical best,” and that Tibetans’ religious freedoms are being protected, but the footage and first-person accounts from exiled Tibetan interviewees in FRONTLINE’s “Battle for Tibet” paint a different picture.

The documentary investigates the Chinese Communist Party’s rule over the tightly-controlled territory and the struggle over the survival of Tibetan language, culture and religion.

The film examines China’s branding of the Dalai Lama as an anti-China separatist, despite his repeated statements that he is no longer seeking Tibetan independence and would accept self-rule within China — and explores China’s pursuit of a campaign to choose his successor. 

China insists that life in Tibet is “significantly better” for the people there because of its rule, which it says must continue. 

“Battle for Tibet” is a Hardcash production with GBH/FRONTLINE and ITV. The director and producer is Gesbeen Mohammad. The senior producers are Dan Edge and Eamonn Matthews. The editor-in-chief and executive producer of FRONTLINE is Raney Aronson-Rath.

      Damien Neil
      19 February 2025
      One of Go’s signature features is built-in support for concurrency.
Goroutines and channels are simple and effective primitives for
writing concurrent programs.However, testing concurrent programs can be difficult and error prone.In Go 1.24, we are introducing a new, experimental
 package
to support testing concurrent code. This post will explain the motivation behind
this experiment, demonstrate how to use the synctest package, and discuss its potential future.In Go 1.24, the  package is experimental and
not subject to the Go compatibility promise.
It is not visible by default.
To use it, compile your code with  set in your environment.Testing concurrent programs is difficultTo begin with, let us consider a simple example.The  function
arranges for a function to be called in its own goroutine after a context is canceled.
Here is a possible test for :func TestAfterFunc(t *testing.T) {
    ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

    calledCh := make(chan struct{}) // closed when AfterFunc is called
    context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
        close(calledCh)
    })

    // TODO: Assert that the AfterFunc has not been called.

    cancel()

    // TODO: Assert that the AfterFunc has been called.
}
We want to check two conditions in this test:
The function is not called before the context is canceled,
and the function  called after the context is canceled.Checking a negative in a concurrent system is difficult.
We can easily test that the function has not been called ,
but how do we check that it  be called?A common approach is to wait for some amount of time before
concluding that an event will not happen.
Let’s try introducing a helper function to our test which does this.// funcCalled reports whether the function was called.
funcCalled := func() bool {
    select {
    case <-calledCh:
        return true
    case <-time.After(10 * time.Millisecond):
        return false
    }
}

if funcCalled() {
    t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
}

cancel()

if !funcCalled() {
    t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
}
This test is slow:
10 milliseconds isn’t a lot of time, but it adds up over many tests.This test is also flaky:
10 milliseconds is a long time on a fast computer,
but it isn’t unusual to see pauses lasting several seconds
on shared and overloaded
CI
systems.We can make the test less flaky at the expense of making it slower,
and we can make it less slow at the expense of making it flakier,
but we can’t make it both fast and reliable.Introducing the testing/synctest packageThe  package solves this problem.
It allows us to rewrite this test to be simple, fast, and reliable,
without any changes to the code being tested.The package contains only two functions:  and . calls a function in a new goroutine.
This goroutine and any goroutines started by it
exist in an isolated environment which we call a .
 waits for every goroutine in the current goroutine’s bubble
to block on another goroutine in the bubble.Let’s rewrite our test above using the  package.func TestAfterFunc(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())

        funcCalled := false
        context.AfterFunc(ctx, func() {
            funcCalled = true
        })

        synctest.Wait()
        if funcCalled {
            t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function called before context is canceled")
        }

        cancel()

        synctest.Wait()
        if !funcCalled {
            t.Fatalf("AfterFunc function not called after context is canceled")
        }
    })
}
This is almost identical to our original test,
but we have wrapped the test in a  call
and we call  before asserting that the function has been called or not.The  function waits for every goroutine in the caller’s bubble to block.
When it returns, we know that the context package has either called the function,
or will not call it until we take some further action.This test is now both fast and reliable.The test is simpler, too:
we have replaced the  channel with a boolean.
Previously we needed to use a channel to avoid a data race between
the test goroutine and the  goroutine,
but the  function now provides that synchronization.The race detector understands  calls,
and this test passes when run with .
If we remove the second  call,
the race detector will correctly report a data race in the test.Concurrent code often deals with time.Testing code that works with time can be difficult.
Using real time in tests causes slow and flaky tests,
as we have seen above.
Using fake time requires avoiding  package functions,
and designing the code under test to work with
an optional fake clock.The  package makes it simpler to test code that uses time.Goroutines in the bubble started by  use a fake clock.
Within the bubble, functions in the  package operate on the
fake clock. Time advances in the bubble when all goroutines are
blocked.To demonstrate, let’s write a test for the
 function.
 creates a child of a context,
which expires after a given timeout.func TestWithTimeout(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        const timeout = 5 * time.Second
        ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), timeout)
        defer cancel()

        // Wait just less than the timeout.
        time.Sleep(timeout - time.Nanosecond)
        synctest.Wait()
        if err := ctx.Err(); err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("before timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want nil", err)
        }

        // Wait the rest of the way until the timeout.
        time.Sleep(time.Nanosecond)
        synctest.Wait()
        if err := ctx.Err(); err != context.DeadlineExceeded {
            t.Fatalf("after timeout, ctx.Err() = %v; want DeadlineExceeded", err)
        }
    })
}
We write this test just as if we were working with real time.
The only difference is that we wrap the test function in ,
and call  after each  call to wait for the context
package’s timers to finish running.A key concept in  is the bubble becoming .
This happens when every goroutine in the bubble is blocked,
and can only be unblocked by another goroutine in the bubble.When a bubble is durably blocked:If there is an outstanding  call, it returns.Otherwise, time advances to the next time that could unblock a goroutine, if any.Otherwise, the bubble is deadlocked and  panics.A bubble is not durably blocked if any goroutine is blocked
but might be woken by some event from outside the bubble.The complete list of operations which durably block a goroutine is:a send or receive on a nil channela send or receive blocked on a channel created within the same bubblea select statement where every case is durably blockingOperations on a  are not durably blocking.It is common for functions to acquire a global mutex.
For example, a number of functions in the reflect package
use a global cache guarded by a mutex.
If a goroutine in a synctest bubble blocks while acquiring
a mutex held by a goroutine outside the bubble,
it is not durably blocked—it is blocked, but will be unblocked
by a goroutine from outside its bubble.Since mutexes are usually not held for long periods of time,
we simply exclude them from ’s consideration.Channels created within a bubble behave differently from ones created outside.Channel operations are durably blocking only if the channel is bubbled
(created in the bubble).
Operating on a bubbled channel from outside the bubble panics.These rules ensure that a goroutine is durably blocked only when
communicating with goroutines within its bubble.External I/O operations, such as reading from a network connection,
are not durably blocking.Network reads may be unblocked by writes from outside the bubble,
possibly even from other processes.
Even if the only writer to a network connection is also in the same bubble,
the runtime cannot distinguish between a connection waiting for more data to arrive
and one where the kernel has received data and is in the process of delivering it.Testing a network server or client with synctest will generally
require supplying a fake network implementation.
For example, the  function
creates a pair of s that use an in-memory network connection
and can be used in synctest tests.The  function starts a goroutine in a new bubble.
It returns when every goroutine in the bubble has exited.
It panics if the bubble is durably blocked
and cannot be unblocked by advancing time.The requirement that every goroutine in the bubble exit before Run returns
means that tests must be careful to clean up any background goroutines
before completing.Let’s look at another example, this time using the 
package to test a networked program.
For this example, we’ll test the  package’s handling of
the 100 Continue response.An HTTP client sending a request can include an “Expect: 100-continue”
header to tell the server that the client has additional data to send.
The server may then respond with a 100 Continue informational response
to request the rest of the request,
or with some other status to tell the client that the content is not needed.
For example, a client uploading a large file might use this feature to
confirm that the server is willing to accept the file before sending it.Our test will confirm that when sending an “Expect: 100-continue” header
the HTTP client does not send a request’s content before the server
requests it, and that it does send the content after receiving a
100 Continue response.Often tests of a communicating client and server can use a
loopback network connection. When working with ,
however, we will usually want to use a fake network connection
to allow us to detect when all goroutines are blocked on the network.
We’ll start this test by creating an  (an HTTP client) that uses
an in-memory network connection created by .func Test(t *testing.T) {
    synctest.Run(func() {
        srvConn, cliConn := net.Pipe()
        defer srvConn.Close()
        defer cliConn.Close()
        tr := &http.Transport{
            DialContext: func(ctx context.Context, network, address string) (net.Conn, error) {
                return cliConn, nil
            },
            // Setting a non-zero timeout enables "Expect: 100-continue" handling.
            // Since the following test does not sleep,
            // we will never encounter this timeout,
            // even if the test takes a long time to run on a slow machine.
            ExpectContinueTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        }
We send a request on this transport with the “Expect: 100-continue” header set.
The request is sent in a new goroutine, since it won’t complete until the end of the test.        body := "request body"
        go func() {
            req, _ := http.NewRequest("PUT", "http://test.tld/", strings.NewReader(body))
            req.Header.Set("Expect", "100-continue")
            resp, err := tr.RoundTrip(req)
            if err != nil {
                t.Errorf("RoundTrip: unexpected error %v", err)
            } else {
                resp.Body.Close()
            }
        }()
We read the request headers sent by the client.        req, err := http.ReadRequest(bufio.NewReader(srvConn))
        if err != nil {
            t.Fatalf("ReadRequest: %v", err)
        }
Now we come to the heart of the test.
We want to assert that the client will not send the request body yet.We start a new goroutine copying the body sent to the server into a ,
wait for all goroutines in the bubble to block, and verify that we haven’t read anything
from the body yet.If we forget the  call, the race detector will correctly complain
about a data race, but with the  this is safe.        var gotBody strings.Builder
        go io.Copy(&gotBody, req.Body)
        synctest.Wait()
        if got := gotBody.String(); got != "" {
            t.Fatalf("before sending 100 Continue, unexpectedly read body: %q", got)
        }
We write a “100 Continue” response to the client and verify that it now sends the
request body.        srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 100 Continue\r\n\r\n"))
        synctest.Wait()
        if got := gotBody.String(); got != body {
            t.Fatalf("after sending 100 Continue, read body %q, want %q", got, body)
        }
And finally, we finish up by sending the “200 OK” response to conclude the request.We have started several goroutines during this test.
The  call will wait for all of them to exit before returning.        srvConn.Write([]byte("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n"))
    })
}
This test can be easily extended to test other behaviors,
such as verifying that the request body is not sent if the server does not ask for it,
or that it is sent if the server does not respond within a timeout.We are introducing 
in Go 1.24 as an  package.
Depending on feedback and experience
we may release it with or without amendments,
continue the experiment,
or remove it in a future version of Go.The package is not visible by default.

He also says Linus Torvalds has privately stated he will override objections to Rust code, effectively making its adoption inevitable. Phoronix's Michael Larabel has the latest: The latest on Hellwig's perspective of Rust code within the Linux kernel is below. Some interesting insight from a dissenting view. The thread in full can be found on the Rust for Linux mailing list.
 
[Here's an excerpt from the thread:] "I don't think having a web page in any form is useful. If you want it to be valid it has to be in the kernel tree and widely agreed on. It also states factually incorrect information. E.g. 'Some subsystems may decide they do not want to have Rust code for the time being, typically for bandwidth reasons. This is fine and expected.' while Linus in private said that he absolutely is going to merge Rust code over a maintainers objection. (He did so in private in case you are looking for a reference). So as of now, as a Linux developer or maintainer you must deal with Rust if you want to or not. [...] Right now the rules is Linus can force you whatever he wants (it's his project obviously) and I think he needs to spell that out including the expectations for contributors very clearly." 

Inevitably there was a response... Torvalds: Rust Kernel Code Isn't Forced In Over Maintainers' Objections.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>USS Yorktown: What Life Was Like Onboard An Aircraft Carrier During WW2</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSv2HLkHEN0</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/VSv2HLkHEN0?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 22:00:19 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Fighting Lady is a 1944 documentary film directed by Edward Steichen, produced by the U.S. Navy and narrated by Lt.

It used to be that the first step of data science was to get familiar with your data. However, as modern LLM datasets have gotten larger, dataset exploration tools have not kept up. Kenny makes the case that user interfaces have been under-appreciated in the Python-centric world of AI, and new tools are needed to enable advances in machine learning. Our conversation also dives into new methods of using LLM models themselves to assist data engineers in actually looking at their data.Kenny has been working in AI for over 20 years. First in academia as a ML Ph.D. student at USC (before it was cool). Kenny then co-founded Algorithmia to solve the problem of hosting and distribution of ML models running on GPUs (also before it was cool). Algortihmia was an early pioneer of the MLOps space and was acquired by DataRobot in 2021.

When reading "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," most readers visualize the queen’s croquet game play out in their heads. A few might see the scene in vivid detail. However, a small fraction of readers have a drastically different experience: within their heads, they "see" absolutely nothing. Why do some people have an inability to visualize images? Adam Zeman explores the science of aphantasia.

Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is exactly as it sounds, with Goro Majima returning as a fully fledged protagonist for the first time since 2015's Yakuza 0. Unlike that game--which saw Kiryu share the spotlight--the focus this time around is squarely on everyone's favorite eyepatched goofball: the perfect leading man for one of the series' more bizarre entries. No one commits to the bit quite like Majima, which is partly why Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii avoids the risk of diminishing returns, despite being the third Like a Dragon game in the past 15 months. This high-seas adventure doesn't stack up against the series' best, but the pirate theme does just enough to differentiate a jaunty return to the Hawaii.Set six months after the events of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii opens with Majima waking up on a beach somewhere in the Pacific. He has no memory of how he got there, his name, or his storied past as a crime boss/cabaret manager/construction-company owner. All he knows is that a young boy named Noah saved his life, and for whatever reason, Hawaii and the surrounding islands are now full of cutlass-wielding pirates who look like they've been pulled out of Tortuga during the 1600s. What follows is the hunt for a long-lost legendary treasure that sees Majima reinvent himself as the pirate captain of his own ship, complete with an ever-expanding crew of new and familiar characters. Stuffing the coffers with booty might be the end goal, but this is also a tale about the friends we made along the way.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Free Software Foundation Speaks Up Against Red Hat Source Code Announcement</title><link>https://linux.slashdot.org/story/25/02/18/0953205/free-software-foundation-speaks-up-against-red-hat-source-code-announcement?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>msmash</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Tue, 18 Feb 2025 12:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[PAjamian writes: Two years ago Red Hat announced an end to its public source code availability. This caused a great deal of outcry from the Enterprise Linux community at large. Since then many have waited for a statement from the Free Software Foundation concerning their stance on the matter. Now, nearly two years later the FSF has finally responded to questions regarding their stance on the issue with the following statement: Generally, we don't agree with what Red Hat is doing. Whether it constitutes a violation of the GPL would require legal analysis and the FSF does not give legal advice. However, as the stewards of the GNU GPL we can speak how it is intended to be applied and Red Hat's approach is certainly contrary to the spirit of the GPL. This is unfortunate, because we would expect such flagship organizations to drive the movement forward. When asked if the FSF would be willing to intervene on behalf of the community they had this to say:As of today, we are not aware of any issue with Red Hat's new policy that we could pursue on legal grounds. However, if you do find a violation, please follow these instructions and send a report to license-violation@gnu.org.

However, this method is highly dependent on the number of servers, and any change in N can lead to , causing a major redistribution of keys (requests). addresses this issue by ensuring that only a small subset of keys need to be reassigned when nodes are added or removed.Popularized by , it has now become a fundamental technique in distributed databases like DynamoDB, Cassandra and ScyllaDB.In this article, we’ll explore what consistent hashing is, why it’s needed, how it works, and how to implement it in code.Imagine you're building a high-traffic web application that serves millions of users daily. To handle the load efficiently, you distribute incoming requests across multiple backend servers using a .Your system consists of  (), and requests are assigned using a hash function that maps each user's IP address to a specific server.The process works like this:The load balancer takes a user’s IP address (or session ID).A  maps the IP to one of the backend servers by taking the sum of bytes in the IP address and computing  (since we have 5 servers).The request is routed to the assigned server, ensuring that the same user is always directed to the same server for session consistency.Everything Works Fine… Until You ScaleThis approach works as long as the number of servers remains constant. But what happens when you ?Scenario 1: Adding a New Server (S5)As traffic increases, you decide to  by adding a new backend server (). Now, the hash function must be modified to use  instead of since we have 6 servers now.This seemingly simple change completely disrupts the existing mapping, causing most users to be reassigned to different servers.This results into , leading to high overhead, and potential downtime.Scenario 2: Removing a Server (S4)Now, let’s say one of the servers () fails or is removed. The number of servers drops to 4, forcing the hash function to switch from  to .Even though only  server was removed, most users are reassigned to different servers. This can cause:Active users may be logged out or disconnected.Cached data becomes irrelevant, increasing database load.Severe performance degradation: The system may struggle to run efficiently.The Solution: Consistent Hashing offers a more scalable and efficient solution by ensuring that only a  are reassigned when scaling up or down.It performs really well when operated in dynamic environments, where the system scales up and down frequently.Consistent hashing is a distributed hashing technique used to efficiently distribute data across multiple nodes (servers, caches, etc.).It uses a  (hash ring) with a large and constant hash space.Both nodes (servers, caches, or databases) and keys (data items) are mapped to positions on this hash ring using a .Unlike modulo-based hashing, where changes in the number of nodes cause large-scale remapping, consistent hashing ensures that only a small fraction of keys are reassigned when a node is added or removed, making it highly scalable and efficient.In consistent hashing, when the number of nodes changes, only keys need to be reassigned, where  is the total number of keys and  is the total number of nodes.2.1 Constructing the Hash RingInstead of distributing keys based on , consistent hashing places both servers and keys on a circular hash ring.We use a large, fixed hash space ranging from  to  (assuming a 32-bit hash function).This creates a circular structure, where values wrap around after reaching the maximum limit.Placing Servers on the RingEach  is assigned a position on the hash ring by computing .Using the above example with , the hash function distributes them at different positions around the ring.When a key is added, its position is determined by computing .Example: a user’s request is assigned a position on the ring based on the hash of their IP address: We then move clockwise around the ring until we find the next available server.The key (or request) is assigned to this server for storage or retrieval. In case a key’s hash falls directly on a node’s position, it belongs to that node.Suppose we add a to the system.The position of  falls between  and  in the hash ring. takes over all keys (requests) that fall between  and , which were previously handled by .requests which were originally assigned to  will now be redirected to This demonstrates how consistent hashing efficiently redistributes keys with minimal disruption, ensuring that only a small subset of keys are reassigned when new servers are added.When a server, such as , fails or is removed from the system:All keys previously assigned to  are reassigned to the next available server in the ring ().Only the keys (requests) that were mapped to  need to move, while all other keys remain unaffected.This results in , unlike traditional hashing where removing a node would require reassigning most keys.In , each server is assigned  on the hash ring. However, this can lead to , especially when:The number of servers is small.Some servers accidentally get clustered together, creating .A server is , causing a sudden load shift to its immediate neighbor. are a technique used in consistent hashing to improve  and  by distributing data more evenly across servers.Instead of assigning one position per server, each physical server is assigned  (virtual nodes) on the hash ring.Each server is hashed multiple times to different locations on the ring.When a request (key) is hashed, it is assigned to the next virtual node in a clockwise direction.The request is then routed to the actual server associated with the virtual node.Assume we have three physical servers (S1, S2, S3). Without virtual nodes, their positions might be:S1 → Position 10
S2 → Position 50
S3 → Position 90If , all its keys must be reassigned to , which can create an overload.With , each server is hashed multiple times:S1-1 → Position 10
S1-2 → Position 70
S1-3 → Position 120
S2-1 → Position 50
S2-2 → Position 80
S2-3 → Position 160
S3-1 → Position 30
S3-2 → Position 90
S3-3 → Position 140Now, instead of just one point,  is represented at , making the distribution .If , its keys are more evenly redistributed among , rather than all going to .Stores hash values → server mappings. Uses  (replicas) for better load balancing.Maintains a  of hash values for efficient lookups.Tracks active physical servers.Calls  for each server, hashing it multiple times (based on ) to ensure even distribution.Uses  to convert strings into large integers for consistent placement on the hash ring.Generates multiple hash values for each server (, , etc.).Stores these in  and maintains a sorted order in  for fast lookup.Deletes the server’s hash values and its virtual nodes from  and .Hashes the input key and finds the closest  server using .

Many engineers fall into the day-to-day routine of writing code without a clear idea of how to grow their careers.This happened to me. At my first job at Amazon, I landed code without knowing what I could do to grow my skills. I left that job within eight months because I felt I wasn’t growing as an engineer. Three years later, I made it to Staff Software Engineer at Instagram after tons of mentorship. Early on, I learned that being good at coding wasn’t enough to get promoted; you have to think strategically about your career and often need to develop new behaviors to move up.In this article, I’ll share everything that helped me fast-track my way up the ladder, from developing the right mindset to making key moves that many overlook. Even if rapid growth isn’t your goal, this guide has learnings for all tech career paths.Software Engineering LevelsAn Algorithm for PromotionJunior (IC3) → Mid-level (IC4)Mid-level (IC4) → Senior (IC5)Senior (IC5) → Staff (IC6)Software Engineering LevelsNote: “IC” = “Individual Contributor”In software engineering, companies measure career progression by levels that measure both behaviors and impact within the company. While the exact titles and structure can vary between companies, most tech companies follow a similar system: - Early in your career, working on smaller, well-defined tasks with guidance from more experienced engineers. - More autonomous, handling moderately complex projects, and beginning to take initiative in improving the codebase and what they build. - Leading larger projects with team-level influence. You’ll mentor and guide the team while having a broad impact on the codebase.: Focusing on cross-team collaboration and solving org-wide challenges. Staff engineers are strategic thinkers who influence the technical direction of their organization.Senior Staff Engineer and Beyond (IC7+): Senior staff engineers and up operate with top technical expertise, driving large-scale initiatives that have a broad impact on the company. Senior staff engineers mentor staff engineers and work closely with executive leadership to meet business objectives.Your impact and compensation increase as you progress, which is a lot more satisfying in my experience. Not to mention that the skills that get you promoted also let you control what you and the company work on.Also, many companies consider only senior engineers (IC5) and higher to be “terminal levels.” You must eventually get promoted to IC5, or you’ll be managed out. Most engineers are promoted in time, so it’s not meant to scare you but to encourage you to grow.An Algorithm For PromotionThere’s a common set of steps across all promotions that will get you to Staff:1) Exceed expectations at your current level - Your manager will be hesitant to find you opportunities at the next level if they have concerns about your performance at the current level. Also, when your manager puts together a promotion packet, it’ll contain a history of your past ratings. The promotion committee will have concerns about your packet if you have a history of only meeting expectations for your level. Work with your manager to understand the expectations for your level and how to exceed them.2) Be direct with your manager about promotion - Once you know you’re exceeding expectations for your level, ask your manager what next-level performance looks like. Your manager plays a huge role in your promotion. They build your case and advocate for it, so they have a lot of influence on this process. Also, the lower the level, the more control your manager has. IC3 -> IC4 promotions are straightforward, so your manager’s perspective is usually what happens. For IC5 -> IC6, there is a lot more ambiguity, so your manager serves more as a middleman between you and the promotion committee. Your manager still plays a significant role in writing your packet and delivering feedback.3) Find next-level scope - If you only work on projects that fit your level’s behaviors, you won’t get any closer to promotion, no matter how good your work is. One simple pattern for finding next-level scope is brainstorming projects with engineers who are 1-2 levels higher than you are. Often, they will have a lot of projects sitting in their backlog that are big enough to help you get promoted. If you take on one of their projects, they’ll often help mentor you, review your designs and code, and give you strong peer feedback for your future promotion packet. I wrote more on this here. Make sure to confirm with your manager that they agree that what you’re working on fits the behaviors of the next level.4) Maintain next-level behaviors and impact - The duration you need to perform at the next level varies depending on your level and your company. At minimum though, you need to maintain that performance for 6-12 months. This is because promotions are “lagging” in tech. You must prove that you’re already operating at the next level before getting promoted. This reduces the risk of failing to meet expectations at the new level.Getting promoted faster is a matter of doing steps (1), (2) and (3) as fast as possible. The best you can do is immediately start exceeding expectations in your first half and working with your manager on the next level.Almost every team has scope for more Senior Engineers (IC5). You can get promoted up to that level if you have the skills and behaviors. Past that, situation and business scope play a much larger role. Many teams don’t need someone who has Staff-level leadership and technical skills.

His departure from Asahi follows a contentious exchange with Linus Torvalds over development processes and social media advocacy. After quitting kernel maintenance earlier this month, the conflict escalated when Martin suggested that "shaming on social media" might be necessary to effect change. 

Torvalds sharply rejected this approach, stating that "social media brigading just makes me not want to have anything at all to do with your approach" and suggested that Martin himself might be the problem. In his final resignation announcement from Asahi, Martin wrote: "I no longer have any faith left in the kernel development process or community management approach." 

The dispute reflects deeper tensions in the Linux kernel community, particularly around the integration of Rust code. It follows the August departure of another key Rust for Linux maintainer, Wedson Almeida Filho from Microsoft. According to Sonatype's research, more than 300,000 open source projects have slowed or halted updates since 2020.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>This Is The Perfect Bowling Strategy</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqo1lQL59VI</link><author>Veritasium</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/mqo1lQL59VI?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 16:49:48 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHnyfMqiRRG1u-2MsSQLbXA">Veritasium</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[What is the optimal strategy for bowling? #science #veritasium #physics #bowling]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>What Falling in Love Does to You #shorts</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmgRBiRMmAU</link><author>Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/KmgRBiRMmAU?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Fri, 14 Feb 2025 15:00:23 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Being in love impacts your brain and body significantly!

completed the largest migration in Kubernetes history, removing the in-tree
cloud provider. While the component migration is now done, this leaves some additional
complexity for users and installer projects (for example, kOps or Cluster API) . We will go
over those additional steps and failure points and make recommendations for cluster owners.
This migration was complex and some logic had to be extracted from the core components,
building four new subsystems.One of the most critical functionalities of the cloud controller manager is the node controller,
which is responsible for the initialization of the nodes.As you can see in the following diagram, when the  starts, it registers the Node
object with the apiserver, Tainting the node so it can be processed first by the
cloud-controller-manager. The initial Node is missing the cloud-provider specific information,
like the Node Addresses and the Labels with the cloud provider specific information like the
Node, Region and Instance type information.Chicken and egg problem sequence diagramThis new initialization process adds some latency to the node readiness. Previously, the kubelet
was able to initialize the node at the same time it created the node. Since the logic has moved
to the cloud-controller-manager, this can cause a chicken and egg problem
during the cluster bootstrapping for those Kubernetes architectures that do not deploy the
controller manager as the other components of the control plane, commonly as static pods,
standalone binaries or daemonsets/deployments with tolerations to the taints and using
 (more on this below)Examples of the dependency problemAs noted above, it is possible during bootstrapping for the cloud-controller-manager to be
unschedulable and as such the cluster will not initialize properly. The following are a few
concrete examples of how this problem can be expressed and the root causes for why they might
occur.These examples assume you are running your cloud-controller-manager using a Kubernetes resource
(e.g. Deployment, DaemonSet, or similar) to control its lifecycle. Because these methods
rely on Kubernetes to schedule the cloud-controller-manager, care must be taken to ensure it
will schedule properly.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to uninitialized taintAs noted in the Kubernetes documentation, when the kubelet is started with the command line
flag --cloud-provider=external, its corresponding  object will have a no schedule taint
named node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized added. Because the cloud-controller-manager
is responsible for removing the no schedule taint, this can create a situation where a
cloud-controller-manager that is being managed by a Kubernetes resource, such as a 
or , may not be able to schedule.If the cloud-controller-manager is not able to be scheduled during the initialization of the
control plane, then the resulting  objects will all have the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized no schedule taint. It also means that this taint
will not be removed as the cloud-controller-manager is responsible for its removal. If the no
schedule taint is not removed, then critical workloads, such as the container network interface
controllers, will not be able to schedule, and the cluster will be left in an unhealthy state.Example: Cloud controller manager not scheduling due to not-ready taintThe next example would be possible in situations where the container network interface (CNI) is
waiting for IP address information from the cloud-controller-manager (CCM), and the CCM has not
tolerated the taint which would be removed by the CNI."The Node controller detects whether a Node is ready by monitoring its health and adds or removes this taint accordingly."One of the conditions that can lead to a Node resource having this taint is when the container
network has not yet been initialized on that node. As the cloud-controller-manager is responsible
for adding the IP addresses to a Node resource, and the IP addresses are needed by the container
network controllers to properly configure the container network, it is possible in some
circumstances for a node to become stuck as not ready and uninitialized permanently.This situation occurs for a similar reason as the first example, although in this case, the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint is used with the no execute effect and thus will cause the
cloud-controller-manager not to run on the node with the taint. If the cloud-controller-manager is
not able to execute, then it will not initialize the node. It will cascade into the container
network controllers not being able to run properly, and the node will end up carrying both the
node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized and node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taints,
leaving the cluster in an unhealthy state.There is no one “correct way” to run a cloud-controller-manager. The details will depend on the
specific needs of the cluster administrators and users. When planning your clusters and the
lifecycle of the cloud-controller-managers please consider the following guidance:For cloud-controller-managers running in the same cluster, they are managing.Use host network mode, rather than the pod network: in most cases, a cloud controller manager
will need to communicate with an API service endpoint associated with the infrastructure.
Setting “hostNetwork” to true will ensure that the cloud controller is using the host
networking instead of the container network and, as such, will have the same network access as
the host operating system. It will also remove the dependency on the networking plugin. This
will ensure that the cloud controller has access to the infrastructure endpoint (always check
your networking configuration against your infrastructure provider’s instructions).Use a scalable resource type.  and  are useful for controlling the
lifecycle of a cloud controller. They allow easy access to running multiple copies for redundancy
as well as using the Kubernetes scheduling to ensure proper placement in the cluster. When using
these primitives to control the lifecycle of your cloud controllers and running multiple
replicas, you must remember to enable leader election, or else your controllers will collide
with each other which could lead to nodes not being initialized in the cluster.Target the controller manager containers to the control plane. There might exist other
controllers which need to run outside the control plane (for example, Azure’s node manager
controller). Still, the controller managers themselves should be deployed to the control plane.
Use a node selector or affinity stanza to direct the scheduling of cloud controllers to the
control plane to ensure that they are running in a protected space. Cloud controllers are vital
to adding and removing nodes to a cluster as they form a link between Kubernetes and the
physical infrastructure. Running them on the control plane will help to ensure that they run
with a similar priority as other core cluster controllers and that they have some separation
from non-privileged user workloads.
It is worth noting that an anti-affinity stanza to prevent cloud controllers from running
on the same host is also very useful to ensure that a single node failure will not degrade
the cloud controller performance.Ensure that the tolerations allow operation. Use tolerations on the manifest for the cloud
controller container to ensure that it will schedule to the correct nodes and that it can run
in situations where a node is initializing. This means that cloud controllers should tolerate
the node.cloudprovider.kubernetes.io/uninitialized taint, and it should also tolerate any
taints associated with the control plane (for example, node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
or node-role.kubernetes.io/master). It can also be useful to tolerate the
node.kubernetes.io/not-ready taint to ensure that the cloud controller can run even when the
node is not yet available for health monitoring.For cloud-controller-managers that will not be running on the cluster they manage (for example,
in a hosted control plane on a separate cluster), then the rules are much more constrained by the
dependencies of the environment of the cluster running the cloud-controller-manager. The advice
for running on a self-managed cluster may not be appropriate as the types of conflicts and network
constraints will be different. Please consult the architecture and requirements of your topology
for these scenarios.This is an example of a Kubernetes Deployment highlighting the guidance shown above. It is
important to note that this is for demonstration purposes only, for production uses please
consult your cloud provider’s documentation.apiVersion: apps/v1

When deciding how to deploy your cloud controller manager it is worth noting that
cluster-proportional, or resource-based, pod autoscaling is not recommended. Running multiple
replicas of a cloud controller manager is good practice for ensuring high-availability and
redundancy, but does not contribute to better performance. In general, only a single instance
of a cloud controller manager will be reconciling a cluster at any given time.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>How Were These Ancient Civilizations So Mysteriously Advanced?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtqbZx_7szk</link><author>Timeline - World History Documentaries</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/EtqbZx_7szk?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 22:00:11 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg">Timeline - World History Documentaries</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Discover the mind-blowing engineering feats of ancient civilizations, from towering pyramids to advanced navigation tools that shaped our modern world.

They say fusion is 50 years away, no matter when you ask. Then why are billions suddenly being pumped into fusion startups? Yes to train LLMs, but there's a reason the technobrats are bullish on fusion in particular. The fact is, the technological challenges have been chipped away and in many cases solved over the past decades, and there's really no one deal-breaker difficulty remaining. One of the final challenges is deciding on the physical vessel to contain our mini artificial stars--and we have some pretty sci-fi options that are nearly ready to go.

Hidden away since his death, they chart his life on the front during the first world war where he served on the western front against the French and English from 1914 to 1918. 

Writing on the morning of the 11th November, Wilhelm reveals in depth his and his comrades feelings and thoughts about the armistice - giving us never before heard insight into those final moments.

His letters and diaries from 1929 onwards reveal the rise of Hitler and the Nazis and his own involvement and ultimately the defeat of Nazi Germany and his own experience of the denazification process.

I failed the next five interviews as well before finally landing my first job at .Since then, I’ve interviewed with many companies and faced my fair share of rejections. However, over the years, my failure rate in coding interviews dropped significantly.By 2022, with just 1.5 months of focused preparation, I successfully cleared interviews at  and .Surprisingly, my success wasn’t due to a dramatic improvement in problem-solving skills. The real game-changer was my approach— and  during the interview.In this article, I’ll share  that made coding interviews significantly easier for me.These tips cover everything you need to know, including:How to systematically approach coding interview problemsKey concepts and patterns you should knowThe type of problems you should practiceHow to choose the right algorithm for a given problemTechniques to optimize your solutionHow to communicate your thought process effectivelyBy applying these strategies, you’ll be able to tackle coding interviews with confidence and massively increase your chances of success.In a coding interview, interviewers want to see how well you , , and  under pressure.Here's a breakdown of what they look for:Understanding the problem: Do you ask clarifying questions instead of making assumptions to ensure you fully understand the problem?: Can you decompose the problem into smaller, manageable parts?: Can you design an optimal solution in terms of time and space complexity?: Do you handle edge cases like empty inputs, duplicates, large values, or special conditions?: Can you explain why one approach is better than another?: Do you have a strong grasp of data structures and algorithms, and can you choose the right one for the problem?Can you quickly compute the time and space complexity of your solution?Explaining your thought process: Can you clearly articulate your approach and why it works?: Are you receptive to hints and able to adjust your approach accordingly?: Do you follow good coding practices (meaningful variable names, proper indentation, modular functions etc..)?Improving the initial solution: Can you optimize and refine your first solution when prompted?Are you able to tackle variations of the original problem?Can you manually walk through your code with sample inputs to verify correctness?Most coding interviews last Depending on the company and interviewer, you may be asked to solve 2-3easy/medium problems or 1 hard problem with follow-ups.Lets assume you are given one problem, with a follow up in a 45-minute interview. Here’s how you can optimally allocate your time:The interviewer may ask you to introduce yourself. Prepare a concise 1-2 minute introduction that highlights your background, experience, and key strengths. Practice it beforehand so that you can deliver it smoothly.Understand the Problem (5-10 mins):  Carefully read the problem statement, ask clarifying questions, and walk through sample inputs and expected outputs.Plan the Approach (10-20 mins): Brainstorm possible solutions, evaluate trade-offs, and discuss time and space complexity.Implement the Code (20-30 mins): Write a clean, modular and readable code.Dry-run your code with sample inputs, debug any issues, and ensure edge cases are handled.Follow-ups and Wrap Up (35-45 mins): Answer follow up questions, and ask thoughtful questions to the interviewer about the company, role, or team.One of the biggest mistakes candidates make in coding interviews is jumping into coding too soon.If you don't fully understand the question, you might end up solving the Here’s how to ensure you grasp the problem before coding:Read the Problem CarefullyTake a moment to absorb the problem statement. Rephrase it in your own words to confirm your understanding. Identify the expected input/output format and any hidden constraints.If anything is unclear, ask questions before diving into the solution. Interviewers appreciate when you seek clarity. Never assume details that aren’t explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.Common clarifications include:Are there duplicate values?Can the input be empty? If so, what should the output be?Should the solution handle negative numbers?Should the output maintain the original order of elements?Is the graph directed or undirected?Does the input contain only lowercase English letters, or can it have uppercase, digits, or special characters?What should happen if multiple solutions exist? Should I return any valid solution, or does the problem have specific requirements?Walk Through Input/Output ExamplesOnce you understand the problem statement and constraints, go over a few input and output examples to make sure you get it.Draw them out if it helps, especially for visual data structures like trees or graphs.Try to take examples that cover different scenarios of the problem. Think about any  that might come up.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>If a frozen Ice Age puppy is a pupsicle, is a frozen kitten a cubsicle?</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGe4GxuAtqE</link><author>PBS Eons</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/cGe4GxuAtqE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 17:15:01 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzR-rom72PHN9Zg7RML9EbA">PBS Eons</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[*****

Its fantasy world isn't as expansive and seamlessly stitched together, but you'd be forgiven for confusing the two at a glance, especially when you're engaged in its first-person combat. Avowed lifts some of the best aspects of the seminal RPG and improves them, especially when it comes to its refined combat. These changes extend to a move away from traditional leveling in favor of a gear-focused approach, as well as the option to experiment with wild weapon combinations. But not all of Avowed's experiments are successes, leading to an uneven role-playing adventure that surprises as much as it frustrates.Washing up on the shores of the Living Lands, you play as one the Godlike: a select few kissed by the grace of a god at birth and left with some distinct (and sometimes frightening) facial features to show for it. On a mission from a distant monarch whose influence within the Living Lands has many of its inhabitants up in arms, your job is to track down the source of a plague that's turning the land's people into mindless, bloodthirsty creatures, before it manages to make it back home. Although it is set in the same universe as Pillars of Eternity, Avowed does a good job of immediately siloing you into an area that requires little knowledge of what is happening across the ocean, but does reference some historical events from time to time. A glossary of important names and places is available as they're brought up in conversation, providing a handy guide that contextualizes some attitudes characters have to certain factions and events around you.Avowed makes a strong initial impression, quickly establishing your Godlike status but with the odd quirk of being the first not to know which god chose you. This isn't the main purpose of your mission, but that changes after a surprising event in the early hours of the game that sets the stage for a more intriguing answer to the plague ravaging the Living Lands. This setup is ultimately squandered, however, with the two big narrative hooks coalescing with one another in routinely expected and uninteresting ways, making the broader strokes of the story largely forgettable. The conversational writing does have its moments of charm, with equally serious and snarky retorts letting you inject some levity into otherwise dire situations with great comedic effect. But the severity of the plague you're trying to stop and the personal journey of finding out why you're the only Godlike without a god is not as captivating as it could be, taking steps along a narrative path that rarely deviates into surprising avenues.Continue Reading at GameSpot]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Is It Time For a Change In GNOME Leadership?</title><link>https://tech.slashdot.org/story/25/02/13/0150244/is-it-time-for-a-change-in-gnome-leadership?utm_source=rss1.0mainlinkanon&amp;utm_medium=feed</link><author>BeauHD</author><category>dev</category><category>slashdot</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://linux.slashdot.org/">Dev - Slashdot - Linux</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Longtime Slashdot reader BrendaEM writes: Command-line aside, Cinnamon is the most effective keeper of the Linux desktop flame -- by not abandoning desktop and laptop computers. Yes, there are other desktop GUIs, such as MATE, and the lightweight Xfce, which are valuable options when low overhead is important, such as in LinuxCNC. However, among the general public lies a great expanse of office workers who need a full-featured Linux desktop.
 
The programmers who work on GNOME and its family of supporting applications enrich many other desktops do their more than their share. These faithful developers deserve better user-interface leadership. GNOME has tried to steer itself into tablet waters, which is admirable, but GNOME 3.x diminished the desktop experience for both laptop and desktop users. For instance, the moment you design what should be a graphical user interface with words such as "Activities," you ask people to change horses midstream. That is not to say that the command line and GUI cannot coexist -- because they can, as they do in many CAD programs.
 
I remember a time when GNOME ruled the Linux desktop -- and I can remember when GNOME left those users behind. Perhaps in a future, GNOME could return to the Linux desktop and join forces with Cinnamon -- so that we may once again have the year of the Linux desktop.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Fostering open source culture (Interview)</title><link>https://changelog.com/podcast/628</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://op3.dev/e/https://cdn.changelog.com/uploads/podcast/628/the-changelog-628.mp3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 13:00:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://changelog.com/podcast">Podcast - Changelog</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Arun Gupta is back, this time with his latest book in hand titled “Fostering Open Source Culture” to share his wisdom and experiences of fostering open source culture.

It’s
something that feels “obvious” to me since I’ve been using the terminal for a
long time, but when I searched for instructions for how to do it, I actually
couldn’t find something that explained all of the steps – a lot of them just
said “add this to ”, but what if you’re not using bash? What if your
bash config is actually in a different file? And how are you supposed to figure
out which directory to add anyway?So I wanted to try to write down some more complete directions and mention some
of the gotchas I’ve run into over the years.Here’s a table of contents:step 1: what shell are you using?If you’re not sure what shell you’re using, here’s a way to find out. Run this:if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out if you’re using , it’ll print out an error like “In fish, please use
$fish_pid” ( isn’t valid syntax in fish, but in any case the error
message tells you that you’re using fish, which you probably already knew)Also bash is the default on Linux and zsh is the default on Mac OS (as of
2024). I’ll only cover bash, zsh, and fish in these directions.step 2: find your shell’s config filein zsh, it’s probably in bash, it might be , but it’s complicated, see the note in the next sectionin fish, it’s probably ~/.config/fish/config.fish (you can run  if you want to be 100% sure)a note on bash’s config fileBash has three possible config files: , , and .If you’re not sure which one your system is set up to use, I’d recommend
testing this way:add  to your If you see “hi there”, that means  is being used! Hooray!Otherwise remove it and try the same thing with You can also try  if the first two options don’t work.(there are a lot of elaborate flow charts out there that explain how bash
decides which config file to use but IMO it’s not worth it to internalize them
and just testing is the fastest way to be sure)step 3: figure out which directory to addLet’s say that you’re trying to install and run a program called 
and it doesn’t work, like this:$ npm install -g http-server
$ http-server
bash: http-server: command not found
How do you find what directory  is in? Honestly in general this is
not that easy – often the answer is something like “it depends on how npm is
configured”. A few ideas:Often when setting up a new installer (like , , , etc),
when you first set it up it’ll print out some directions about how to update
your PATH. So if you’re paying attention you can get the directions then.Sometimes installers will automatically update your shell’s config file
to update your  for youSometimes just Googling “where does npm install things?” will turn up the
answerSome tools have a subcommand that tells you where they’re configured to
install things, like:
Node/npm:  (then append )Go:  (then append )asdf: asdf info | grep ASDF_DIR (then append  and )step 3.1: double check it’s the right directoryOnce you’ve found a directory you think might be the right one, make sure it’s
actually correct! For example, I found out that on my machine,  is
in . I can make sure that it’s the right directory by trying to
run the program  in that directory like this:$ ~/.npm-global/bin/http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./public
It worked! Now that you know what directory you need to add to your ,
let’s move to the next step!step 4: edit your shell configNow we have the 2 critical pieces of information we need:Which directory you’re trying to add to your PATH (like  )Where your shell’s config is (like , , or ~/.config/fish/config.fish)Now what you need to add depends on your shell:Open your shell’s config file, and add a line like this:export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin/
(obviously replace  with the actual directory you’re trying to add)You can do the same thing as in bash, but zsh also has some slightly fancier
syntax you can use if you prefer:path=(
  $path
  ~/.npm-global/bin
)
In fish, the syntax is different:set PATH $PATH ~/.npm-global/bin
(in fish you can also use , some notes on that further down)step 5: restart your shellNow, an extremely important step: updating your shell’s config won’t take
effect if you don’t restart it!open a new terminal (or terminal tab), and maybe close the old one so you don’t get confusedRun  to start a new shell (or  if you’re using zsh, or  if you’re using fish)I’ve found that both of these usually work fine.And you should be done! Try running the program you were trying to run and
hopefully it works now.If not, here are a couple of problems that you might run into:problem 1: it ran the wrong programIf the wrong  of a program is running, you might need to add the
directory to the  of your PATH instead of the end.For example, on my system I have two versions of  installed, which I
can see by running :$ which -a python3
/usr/bin/python3
/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
The one your shell will use is the .If you want to use the Homebrew version, you need to add that directory
() to the  of your PATH instead, by putting this in
your shell’s config file (it’s  instead of the usual )export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin/:$PATH
set PATH ~/.cargo/bin $PATH
problem 2: the program isn’t being run from your shellAll of these directions only work if you’re running the program . If you’re running the program from an IDE, from a GUI, in a cron job,
or some other way, you’ll need to add the directory to your PATH in a different
way, and the exact details might depend on the situation.use the full path to the program you’re running, like /home/bork/bin/my-programput the full PATH you want as the first line of your crontab (something like
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin:….). You can get the full PATH you’re
using in your shell by running .I’m honestly not sure how to handle it in an IDE/GUI because I haven’t run into
that in a long time, will add directions here if someone points me in the right
direction.problem 3: duplicate  entries making it harder to debugIf you edit your path and start a new shell by running  (or , or
), you’ll often end up with duplicate  entries, because the shell
keeps adding new things to your  every time you start your shell.Personally I don’t think I’ve run into a situation where this kind of
duplication breaks anything, but the duplicates can make it harder to debug
what’s going on with your  if you’re trying to understand its contents.Some ways you could deal with this:If you’re debugging your , open a new terminal to do it in so you get
a “fresh” state. This should avoid the duplication.Deduplicate your  at the end of your shell’s config  (for example in
zsh apparently you can do this with )Check that the directory isn’t already in your  when adding it (for
example in fish I believe you can do this with fish_add_path --path /some/directory)How to deduplicate your  is shell-specific and there isn’t always a
built in way to do it so you’ll need to look up how to accomplish it in your
shell.problem 4: losing your history after updating your Here’s a situation that’s easy to get into in bash or zsh:Run  to reload your configPress the up arrow a couple of times to rerun the failed command (or open a new terminal)The failed command isn’t in your history! Why not?This happens because in bash, by default, history is not saved until you exit
the shell.Some options for fixing this:Instead of running  to reload your config, run  (or
 in zsh). This will reload the config inside your current
session.Configure your shell to continuously save your history instead of only saving
the history when the shell exits. (How to do this depends on whether you’re
using bash or zsh, the history options in zsh are a bit complicated and I’m
not exactly sure what the best way is)When you install  (Rust’s installer) for the first time, it gives you
these instructions for how to set up your PATH, which don’t mention a specific
directory at all.This is usually done by running one of the following (note the leading DOT):

. "$HOME/.cargo/env"        	# For sh/bash/zsh/ash/dash/pdksh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env.fish"  # For fish
The idea is that you add that line to your shell’s config, and their script
automatically sets up your  (and potentially other things) for you.This is pretty common (for example Homebrew suggests you eval ), and there are
two ways to approach this:Just do what the tool suggests (like adding  to your shell’s config)Figure out which directories the script they’re telling you to run would add
to your PATH, and then add those manually. Here’s how I’d do that:
Run  in my shell (or the fish version if using fish)Run echo "$PATH" | tr ':' '\n' | grep cargo to figure out which directories it addedSee that it says  and shorten that to Add the directory  to PATH (with the directions in this post)I don’t think there’s anything wrong with doing what the tool suggests (it
might be the “best way”!), but personally I usually use the second approach
because I prefer knowing exactly what configuration I’m changing.fish has a handy function called  that you can run to add a directory to your  like this:fish_add_path /some/directory
This is cool (it’s such a simple command!) but I’ve stopped using it for a couple of reasons:Sometimes  will update the  for every session in the
future (with a “universal variable”) and sometimes it will update the 
just for the current session and it’s hard for me to tell which one it will
do. In theory the docs explain this but I could not understand them.Hopefully this will help some people. Let me know (on Mastodon or Bluesky) if
you there are other major gotchas that have tripped you up when adding a
directory to your PATH, or if you have questions about this post!]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>GenAI Patterns: Reranker</title><link>https://martinfowler.com/articles/gen-ai-patterns/#reranker</link><author>Martin Fowler</author><category>dev</category><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 10:16:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://martinfowler.com/feed.atom">Dev - Martin Fowler</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[LLMs struggle with large amounts of context.

      Cherry Mui
      13 February 2025
      Go 1.24 enhances its WebAssembly (Wasm) capabilities with the
addition of the  directive and the ability to build a reactor
for WebAssembly System Interface (WASI).
These features enable Go developers to export Go functions to Wasm,
facilitating better integration with Wasm hosts and expanding the possibilities
for Go-based Wasm applications.WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System InterfaceWebAssembly (Wasm) is a binary instruction format
that was initially created for web browsers, providing the execution of
high-performance, low-level code at speeds approaching native performance.
Since then, Wasm’s utility has expanded, and it is now used in various
environments beyond the browser.
Notably, cloud providers offer services that directly execute Wasm
executables, taking advantage of the
WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) system call API.
WASI allows these executables to interact with system resources.Go first added support for compiling to Wasm in the 1.11 release, through the
 port.
Go 1.21 added a new port targeting the WASI preview 1 syscall API through the
new  port.Exporting Go Functions to Wasm with Go 1.24 introduces a new compiler directive, , which allows
developers to export Go functions to be called from outside of the
Wasm module, typically from a host application that runs the Wasm runtime.
This directive instructs the compiler to make the annotated function available
as a Wasm export
in the resulting Wasm binary.To use the  directive, simply add it to a function definition://go:wasmexport add
func add(a, b int32) int32 { return a + b }
With this, the Wasm module will have an exported function named  that
can be called from the host.This is analogous to the cgo  directive,
which makes the function available to be called from C,
though  uses a different, simpler mechanism.A WASI reactor is a WebAssembly module that operates continuously, and
can be called upon multiple times to react on events or requests.
Unlike a “command” module, which terminates after its main function finishes,
a reactor instance remains live after initialization, and its exports remain
accessible.With Go 1.24, one can build a WASI reactor with the  build
flag.$ GOOS=wasip1 GOARCH=wasm go build -buildmode=c-shared -o reactor.wasm
The build flag signals to the linker not to generate the  function
(the entry point for a command module), and instead generate an
 function, which performs runtime and package initialization,
along with any exported functions and their dependencies.
The  function must be called before any other exported functions.
The  function will not be automatically invoked.To use a WASI reactor, the host application first initializes it by calling
, then simply invoke the exported functions.
Here is an example using Wazero, a Go-based Wasm runtime
implementation:// Create a Wasm runtime, set up WASI.
r := wazero.NewRuntime(ctx)
defer r.Close(ctx)
wasi_snapshot_preview1.MustInstantiate(ctx, r)

// Configure the module to initialize the reactor.
config := wazero.NewModuleConfig().WithStartFunctions("_initialize")

// Instantiate the module.
wasmModule, _ := r.InstantiateWithConfig(ctx, wasmFile, config)

// Call the exported function.
fn := wasmModule.ExportedFunction("add")
var a, b int32 = 1, 2
res, _ := fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(a), api.EncodeI32(b))
c := api.DecodeI32(res[0])
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", a, b, c)

// The instance is still alive. We can call the function again.
res, _ = fn.Call(ctx, api.EncodeI32(b), api.EncodeI32(c))
fmt.Printf("add(%d, %d) = %d\n", b, c, api.DecodeI32(res[0]))
The  directive and the reactor build mode allow applications to
be extended by calling into Go-based Wasm code.
This is particularly valuable for applications that have adopted Wasm as a
plugin or extension mechanism with well-defined interfaces.
By exporting Go functions, applications can leverage the Go Wasm modules to
provide functionality without needing to recompile the entire application.
Furthermore, building as a reactor ensures that the exported functions can be
called multiple times without requiring reinitialization, making it suitable
for long-running applications or services.Supporting rich types between the host and the clientGo 1.24 also relaxes the constraints on types that can be used as input and
result parameters with  functions.
For example, one can pass a bool, a string, a pointer to an , or a
pointer to a struct which embeds  and contains supported
field types
(see the documentation for detail).
This allows Go Wasm applications to be written in a more natural and ergonomic
way, and removes some unnecessary type conversions.While Go 1.24 has made significant enhancements to its Wasm capabilities,
there are still some notable limitations.Wasm is a single-threaded architecture with no parallelism.
A  function can spawn new goroutines.
But if a function creates a background goroutine, it will not continue
executing when the  function returns, until calling back into
the Go-based Wasm module.While some type restrictions have been relaxed in Go 1.24, there are still
limitations on the types that can be used with  and
 functions.
Due to the unfortunate mismatch between the 64-bit architecture of the client
and the 32-bit architecture of the host, it is not possible to pass pointers in
memory.
For example, a  function cannot take a pointer to a struct that
contains a pointer-typed field.The addition of the ability to build a WASI reactor and export Go functions to
Wasm in Go 1.24 represent a significant step forward for Go’s WebAssembly
capabilities.
These features empower developers to create more versatile and powerful Go-based
Wasm applications, opening up new possibilities for Go in the Wasm ecosystem.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Why Ted Leonsis Wants to Build a &apos;Super City&apos; of Sports Teams | The Deal</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZtSKgjILKw</link><author>Bloomberg Originals</author><category>yt</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/eZtSKgjILKw?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 23:00:38 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUMZ7gohGI9HcU9VNsr2FJQ">Bloomberg Originals</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[In this episode of The Deal, Alex Rodriguez and Jason Kelly sit with Ted Leonsis, founder of Monumental Sports and Entertainment, to discuss how he came to dominate the Washington DC sports scene.

--

After witnessing a bird carrying a single golden hair, King Mark of Cornwall declared his future bride must have equally radiant locks. The only royal matching this description was Princess Isolde of Ireland. So the king sent Tristan, his bravest knight, to extend an olive branch to the royal family and deliver his proposal of marriage. Iseult Gillespie shares the tale of Tristan and Isolde.

In 2021, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, avian flu began aggressively circulating in wildlife. Dead and sick birds began showing up on shorelines. Poultry farms were forced to cull millions of animals, often in horrific ways, to help stop the spread. Egg prices skyrocketed. Farmers lost millions of dollars. The problem doesn’t stop with birds; avian flu has also been found in a wide range of mammals. More than 24,000 sea lions in South America have reportedly died from it. Then, on January 6, 2025, the US reported the first human death. It’s an alarming development, but fortunately an outlier. The truth is avian flu still poses little threat to humans. But if we’re not worried now, when should we be?

The server retains some data from previous requests, making future interactions dependent on past state.In software systems,  refers to any data that persists across requests, such as user sessions, shopping carts, or authentication details.The choice between stateless and stateful architecture can affect scalability, performance, complexity, and cost.In this article, we’ll break down both the approaches, their advantages and trade-offs, and when to use each—with real-world examples.If you’re finding this newsletter valuable and want to deepen your learning, consider becoming a .As a paid subscriber, you'll receive an exclusive deep-dive article every week, access to a structured100+topics and interview questions, and other .In a , the system remembers client or process data () across multiple requests.Once a client connects, the server holds on to certain details—like user preferences, shopping cart contents, or authentication sessions—so the client doesn’t need to resend everything with each request.Stateful systems typically store the state data in a database or in-memory storage. During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections. If you navigate away to browse more items and then return to your cart, your items are still there, waiting for you to check out.Common Patterns in Stateful ArchitectureIf you use  session storage (i.e., each app server keeps its own sessions locally), you can configure your load balancer for “sticky sessions.” This means: Once a client is assigned to , all subsequent requests from that client are routed to .: If Server A fails, the user’s session data is lost or the user is forced to re-log in. Sticky sessions are also less flexible when scaling because you can’t seamlessly redistribute user traffic to other servers.2. Centralized Session StoreA more robust approach is to store session data in a  or  store (e.g., Redis). : All servers can access and update session data for any user. Any server can handle any request, because the session data is not tied to a specific server’s memory.: You introduce network overhead and rely on an external storage. If the centralized storage fails, you lose session data unless you have a fallback strategy.Personalized Experiences: Stateful systems can deliver highly tailored interactions, as they remember user preferences and past actions. Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even if they disconnect and reconnect. Certain operations can be faster because the server already possesses necessary data. Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex, as each server needs to keep track of specific sessions. Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers (if needed) introduces additional challenges. If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data might be lost.E-commerce Shopping Carts – Stores cart contents and user preferences across multiple interactions, even if the user navigates away and returns.Video Streaming Services (Netflix, YouTube) – Remembers user watch progress, recommendations, and session data for a seamless experience.Messaging Apps (WhatsApp, Slack) – Maintains active user sessions and message history for real-time communication.In a  architecture, the server does  preserve client-specific data between individual requests.Each request is treated as , with no memory of previous interactions.Every request must include all necessary information for processing.Once the server responds, it discards any temporary data used for that request.: Most  follow a stateless design. For instance, when you request weather data from a public API, you must provide all required details (e.g., location) in each request. The server processes it, sends a response, and forgets the interaction.Common Patterns in Stateless Architecture1. Token-Based Authentication (JWT)A very popular way to implement statelessness is through tokens, particularly  (JSON Web Tokens):Client Authenticates Once: The user logs in using credentials (username/password) for the first time, and the server issues a signed .: The client includes JWT token in each request (e.g., Authorization: Bearer <token> header).: The server validates the token’s signature and any embedded claims (e.g., user ID, expiry time).: The server does  need to store session data; it just verifies the token on each request.Many APIs, including OAuth-based authentication systems, use JWTs to enable stateless, scalable authentication.Stateless architectures benefit from , ensuring that repeated requests produce the same result. This prevents inconsistencies due to network retries or client errors. A  request with the same payload  updates the user’s data but doesn’t create duplicates.Idempotent APIsensures consistency and reliability, especially in distributed systems where requests might be retried automatically. Stateless systems are inherently easier to scale horizontally. New servers can be added effortlessly, as they don't need to maintain any specific user sessions. Since servers don't track state, the architecture is generally simpler and easier to manage. The failure of a single server won't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.With no session data stored on the server, you free up memory that would otherwise be reserved for session management.Easier to Cache Responses: Since requests are self-contained, caching layers (like CDNs) can more easily store and serve responses. Stateless systems can't provide the same level of personalization or context awareness as stateful systems without additional effort (like using cookies or tokens).The client must keep track of the authentication token or relevant data. If it loses the token, it must re-authenticate. Every request needs to carry all the required information, potentially leading to larger payloads.Microservices Architecture: Each service handles requests independently, relying on external databases or caches instead of maintaining session data.Public APIs (REST, GraphQL): Clients send tokens with each request, eliminating the need for server-side sessions.Tokens are securely stored on the device and sent with every request to authenticate users.Stateless endpoints make caching easier since responses depend only on request parameters, not stored session data. A CDNcan cache and serve repeated requests, improving performance and reducing backend load.There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.The best choice depends on your application’s needs, scalability goals, and user experience expectations.When to Choose Stateful ArchitectureStateful systems are ideal when user context and continuity are critical. Consider a stateful approach if your application:Requires personalization (e.g., user preferences, session history)Needs real-time interactions (e.g., chat applications, multiplayer gaming)Manages multi-step workflows (e.g., online banking transactions, checkout processes)Must retain authentication sessions for security and convenience A shopping cart in an e-commerce app should persist, so users don’t have to re-add items after refreshing the page.When to Choose Stateless ArchitectureStateless systems work best when scalability, simplicity, and resilience are top priorities. Use a stateless approach if your application:Handles a high volume of requests and needs to scale efficientlyDoesn’t require storing client-specific data between requestsNeeds fast, distributed processing without server dependenciesMust ensure reliability and failover readiness A weather API doesn’t need to remember previous requests. Each query includes the location, and the response is processed independently.Hybrid Approaches: The Best of Both WorldsMany modern applications  stateful and stateless components for flexibility.This hybrid approach allows:Stateless APIs for core functionality, ensuring high scalabilityStateful sessions for personalization, improving user experienceExternal session stores (e.g., Redis) to manage state while keeping app servers stateless A video streaming platform (e.g., Netflix) uses a stateless backend for streaming but retains stateful user sessions to track watch history and recommendations.If you found it valuable, hit a like ❤️ and consider subscribing for more such content every week.If you have any questions or suggestions, leave a comment.This post is public so feel free to share it.
