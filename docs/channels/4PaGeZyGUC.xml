You’ll also get 20% off an annual premium subscription.

In this video, we explore how China’s dominance in rare earth elements has become a powerful geopolitical tool—and why the United States is struggling to catch up. From the Mountain Pass mine in California to Apple’s $500 million recycling push, we unpack the strategic importance of rare earths in everything from electric vehicles and smartphones to fiber optics and missile systems.
We also look at the recent Trump–Xi summit, the temporary truce on export controls, and the deeper tensions that remain unresolved. Why are rare earths so hard to substitute? How does China’s export licensing regime work? And what happens if the U.S. gets cut off?

🔍 Topics covered:

Rare earths in global supply chains
China’s export controls and licensing strategy
U.S. efforts to rebuild domestic production
Military vs civilian demand for rare earths
Recycling, substitution, and strategic stockpiling

Some countries have switched to “opt-out” donation systems, where everyone is a potential donor unless they say otherwise, but studies show that policy changes alone aren’t enough. Real progress also depends on better transplant coordination, healthcare resources, and open conversations about donation wishes.

You might have heard of TRAPPIST-1. Discovered in 2017, this system of rocky planets orbiting a red dwarf star has been hailed as the most promising place to search for life outside our solar system. 

And now, one of these planets has just got even more exciting. New observations from the James Webb Telescope reveal the most compelling evidence yet: planet TRAPPIST-1e might have an Earth-like atmosphere. Join us to see what JWST found and why this could be huge.

While the Moldovan capital Chişinău tends to pursue a more pro-European course, many people in Transnistria cling to Russia – despite problems like Transnistria's deep poverty. The region's economy is dominated by a powerful network of oligarchs. Critics speak of a system of mutual protection between business, politics and pro-Russian power structures. 

Until the beginning of 2025, Transnistria's economy was reliant on gas from Russia. A fragile balancing act – as some 80 percent of Transnistria's exports go to the EU. But the energy crisis that followed the gas freeze has exacerbated tensions in the region.  

While pro-Russian actors want to expand their power, supporters of a pro-European course are focusing on greater integration into the EU.

Narcissist. You’ve probably heard these terms used a lot more frequently in recent years. They’re pop psychology terms, also known as therapy-speak, and they’ve become increasingly common in our mainstream vernacular. But oftentimes, people misuse the terminology and let it serve as a blanket term for more complex thoughts and feelings, making it more difficult to receive proper mental health support for clinical diagnoses. Vox correspondent Allie Volpe explains why therapy-speak is so alluring, and how to use more words, not fewer, to describe a situation.

Dan Snow joins After Dark with Anthony Delaney and Maddy Pelling to chat about the brutal reality of sailing in the Age of Sail. They explore the horrifying life at sea for a Royal Navy sailor from the 16th to 19th century, covering the truth about press ganging, shipboard discipline, and the myths vs. realities of naval life.

Dan details the real killers at sea, revealing that more sailors died from disease like scurvy and in catastrophic shipwrecks than in famous naval battles. The conversation also covers the cosmopolitan nature of the crews, the horrors of naval combat, the complex truth about pirates, and what it really took to survive in Nelson's Navy.

It‘s one of the toughest training programs run by the Foreign Legion. In the 3rd Regiment, legionnaires and the special units of friendly armies are trained under particularly harsh conditions.

The soldiers camp in the rainforest, food is rationed and there are no sanitary facilities. Unconditional obedience is mandatory, and even the smallest mistakes are severely punished. 
The 3rd Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion (3e Régiment Étranger d'Infanterie) has been stationed in French Guiana since 1973. It is a region that consists of 90 percent forest and is one of the rainiest areas in the world - inhospitable conditions for both the legionnaires and their equipment. 
The fight against illegal gold prospecting is known as the "Harpie mission". Legionnaires comb through the rainforest before sunrise, often in the pouring rain, to track down the prospectors, who are organized in mafia-like structures and sometimes heavily armed.
A second mission in French Guiana is called "Titan". In this mission, legionnaires protect the international spaceport in Kourou. They have been carrying out this task since 2008.  
At the training center, the CEFE (Centre d'entraînement en forêt équatoriale), legionnaires as well as soldiers from friendly armies are trained in combat. There are usually around 40 participants on a course, most of whom do not make it to the end. Injuries occur on a daily basis and many participants drop out due to total exhaustion or dehydration. The documentary accompanies a legionnaire and a female officer candidate in the French military as they face increasingly tough challenges every day, which repeatedly push them to their physical and mental limits. The documentary offers insights into a world that is very rarely seen by outsiders.

DESCRIPTION
Maurice Naftalin and Stuart Marks discuss the second edition of "Java Generics and Collections", published 19 years after the original. The conversation explores how Java programming has evolved from Java 5 to Java 25, covering major shifts like the move toward immutability, the introduction of sequenced collections, streams, and unmodifiable collections.

They delve into critical design topics including encapsulation of collections, the anemic domain model anti-pattern, the controversial unsupported operation exception, and the challenges of null handling. The book includes new chapters on usage guidance and design retrospectives that reflect decades of accumulated wisdom about the Collections Framework.

But maybe how we define waste should be rethought, treating it instead as an untapped resource. In this episode of An Optimist’s Guide to the Planet, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau travels the world to meet people transforming waste into creation. From state-of-the-art incinerators to mushrooms that eat construction material and an effort to clean one of the world’s most sacred rivers, they are changing the narrative to show how waste is actually a valuable raw material.

Richard Sorge fought against Hitler and National Socialism. Out of conviction for the Communist cause, Richard Sorge acted as a spy in service of Stalin. The man with a German father and a Russian mother was a member of Hitler's NSDAP and was living in Japan, an ally of Nazi-Germany. In 1951 a journalist wrote that, "He had indeed betrayed his fatherland, but in favour of his motherland." And truer words have never been spoken. He was a master spy, duty-bound to the fight against Hitler - a daredevil, a womanizer and a rule breaker. Richard Sorge is not just the model for Ian Fleming's "James Bond" - he was the actual James Bond - a fact that turns this historical documentary into a cinematic thriller.

Soon after, Brendan Carr, the chair of the FCC and an appointee of President Donald Trump, appeared on a conservative podcast and threatened to act against ABC and its parent company, Disney, for Kimmel’s remarks. On September 17, ABC and Disney suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” 

Kimmel’s suspension launched a national debate and protest around freedom of speech and satire. From celebrities like Wanda Sykes to Republicans like Sen. Ted Cruz, people from across the spectrum weighed in on the decision. The show returned days later on September 23, but the FCC’s actions left many questioning whether Kimmel’s First Amendment rights were violated.

This incident is just one of many instances of the gray areas of free speech making its way into the news cycle. In this video, we take a look at the origins of the “inalienable right” to free speech, how the Supreme Court has determined the boundaries of speech (including hate speech), and where free speech might be headed next with a six-justice majority of Republican appointees. As this issue continues to evolve, social media is one of the latest modes of communication adding new layers of complexity to this age-old debate.

They have to climb 3,000 meters and cross rivers and glaciers. Known as Alpine transhumance, this tradition has been recognized by UNESCO as Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  

With 1,400 sheep, Markus and his colleagues make the journey from South Tyrol to Austria every spring. Like his ancestors, Markus spends the whole summer taking care of the animals in the alpine meadows.  

But they can't make a living from farming alone. Shepherds need to find other sources of income or even change jobs altogether. Still, they say what matters to them is that the next generation can carry on this tradition.
