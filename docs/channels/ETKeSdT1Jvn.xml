Now she helps lead the research group’s efforts in machine learning. In this episode, In Young and Ron touch on the porous boundaries between trading, research, and software engineering, which require different sensibilities but are often blended in a single person. They discuss the tension between flexible research tools and robust production systems; the challenges of ML in a low-data, high-noise environment subject to frequent regime changes; and the shift from simple linear models to deep neural networks.You can find the transcript for this episode on our website.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>The Origins of Jim Crow</title><link>https://shows.acast.com/dansnowshistoryhit/episodes/the-origins-of-jim-crow</link><author></author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://sphinx.acast.com/p/acast/s/dansnowshistoryhit/e/67cf1c54d64d9d8e86eefa65/media.mp3?tk=eyJ0ayI6ImRlZmF1bHQiLCJhZHMiOnRydWUsInNwb25zIjp0cnVlLCJzdGF0dXMiOiJwdWJsaWMifQ==&amp;sig=BsnePbprmy9HgeeTXRDwUqmLjz6BLGqp2UScy-aVocY" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 12 Mar 2025 00:30:00 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.historyhit.com/podcasts/">Podcast - HistoryHit</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[The Jim Crow era is one of the darkest periods in American history.

Humans have a sense of right and wrong. Does this mean that morality is absolute? And if it’s absolute, would God be needed to make it so? These are separate questions and both require particular answers to arrive at God. Even theologians are perplexed by God and morality; some even admit it.

We human beings sit roughly midway between the sizes of atoms and galaxies, and both must be so perfectly structured for us to exist. It’s called ‘fine-tuning’ and it’s all so breathtakingly precise that it cries out for explanation. To some, fine-tuning leads to God. To others, there are non-supernatural explanations. Both are startling.

Is God, if there is a God, a personal, conscious, all-powerful Supreme Being? Some offer radically different concepts of ‘God’, exploring novel ideas of what God may be like. They challenge theism—the God of Judaism, Christianity and Islam—with radically new kinds of gods. Is this ‘heresy’? Or enlarging our vision of what the Ultimate can be like?

How can God’s perfect knowledge not eliminate free will? Since God-to-be-God can never be wrong and knows everything, including propositions about future events, how can those propositions about future events, which God knows now, not come to pass in the actual future? Hence, if we cannot do otherwise than what God knew prior, how can we have free will?

‘A new heaven and a new earth’ is the grand vision of the Bible. The Judeo-Christian scriptures tell of a future time when all things shall be made new. What could this mean? Does ‘all’ include the entire cosmos? Multiple universes, if there are such? Could such an ancient vision ever make sense? Believers say, “It’s God’s mystery.” They should say more.

And at what cost? Our world is shaped by choices—some calculated, some reckless, most irreversible. From Kennedy and Khrushchev stepping to the brink of nuclear annihilation to Putin’s recent invasion of Ukraine, leaders have made decisions that have altered the course of humanity. Never was this more true than in the Second World War—the deadliest conflict in human history. WWII transformed the world, reducing ancient cities to rubble, displacing millions, and ushering in the atomic age. At the centre stood six men: Adolf Hitler, Winston Churchill, Benito Mussolini, Joseph Stalin, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Emperor Hirohito. Their decisions—some brilliant, others catastrophic—reshaped nations and decided the fate of millions.In this gripping mini-series, Dan steps inside the war room and breaks down the key strategic moves made by these infamous leaders, with the help of Phillips O’Brien (esteemed professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews). They examine Hitler’s fateful invasion of Russia, Churchill’s attempts to preserve the British Empire, as well as Roosevelt’s quiet manoeuvring and Hirohito’s cautious influence.]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2279 - Ky Dickens</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gF0CrAx_sBM</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/gF0CrAx_sBM?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Wed, 26 Feb 2025 18:00:40 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Ky Dickens is a filmmaker and documentarian.
