Science can deal with God in at least three ways: showing how God is not necessary; showing how God is likely; not relating to God at all. Is only one way best? Atheists claim that scientific explanation eliminates for a ‘God of the gaps’. Theists point to the beauty of mathematics and the cosmos all resulting in human sentience and experience.

If so, you may have heard of the ancient tradition of keening or the superstition of the 'hungry grass'. In this episode, Dan is joined by the hosts of the After Dark podcast, Dr Anthony Delaney and Dr Maddy Pelling, to explore some of the historic rites and beliefs surrounding death and mourning in Ireland. Anthony explains the role of 'keening women' - once persecuted by the government and the church - who would wail and lament at the graveside (and air any mistakes the deceased may have made) as well as the procession down the 'corpse road' and the customs of covering mirrors and opening the window at the point of death.Warning: this episode has an instance of explicit language.Produced by Freddy Chick and edited by Matthew Wilson and Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2403 - Andrew Gallimore</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErO3RuGTXE</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/IErO3RuGTXE?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Thu, 30 Oct 2025 17:00:26 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Andrew Gallimore, PhD, is a chemical pharmacologist and neurobiologist.

What is the extent of God’s creation? If there are multiple universes, did God create each of them? If an infinite number of universes, did God create all of them? Theists may be conflicted: the centrality of human beings in this one universe, and, for Christians, the incarnation on Earth, versus the magnification of God with multiple universes.

What actually happens in the brain during a near-death experience? Neuroscientist Jimo Borjigin shares groundbreaking research that reveals dramatic surges in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine in the moments before death. These chemical floods may explain the feelings of euphoria, tunnels of light, and out-of-body sensations reported by millions. Is this evidence of the afterlife—or proof that the dying brain creates its own final visions?

Idealism is the theory that all reality is consciousness and only consciousness, and that what we perceive to be the physical world is either a manifestation of consciousness or derived from it. Either way, fundamental reality is pure consciousness. What are the arguments for and against Idealism (like the common sense of the physical)?

What would be the theology of multiple persons as God? Why three persons in the Godhead? What’s the difference between polytheism, many gods, and multiple persons in the same God?

If consciousness is 100% physical, we would have to conclude that the same kind of consciousness that we experience as humans can be generated by non-biological entities (eventually). Conversely, if non-biological consciousness would somehow, someday, prove impossible, then consciousness would have to embed some nonphysical aspect. But how would we ever know?

It’s an idea that runs counter to the materialist worldview we’re all taught in school. But the outer edges of scientific inquiry bleed into what can only be called ‘magic.’ With a uniquely science-backed approach, parapsychologist Dean Radin explores the "magical" elements of consciousness including telepathy, spell casting, conjuring spirits, and more.

Dan is joined by historian Dr Alanna Skuse to look at healthcare in Renaissance England, from healing the humours and blood letting to cross animal blood transfusions, skin grafts that involved attaching the face to the upper arm and the notorious treatments of patients at Bedlam, Britain's most famous psychiatric hospital. But not all treatments were bizarre or gruesome; in fact, early practitioners had some pretty progressive ideas around holistic health, the benefits of nature, sleep and friendship.Alanna shares astonishing stories of treatments, patients and practitioners from her new book 'The Surgeon, the Midwife and the Quack: How to Stay Alive in Renaissance England'Produced by Mariana Des Forges and edited by Dougal Patmore]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Joe Rogan Experience #2397 - Richard Lindzen &amp; William Happer</title><link>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zt32chvO_iY</link><author>PowerfulJRE</author><category>podcast</category><enclosure url="https://www.youtube.com/v/Zt32chvO_iY?version=3" length="" type=""/><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2025 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzQUP1qoWDoEbmsQxvdjxgQ">Podcast - Joe Rogan</source><content:encoded><![CDATA[Richard Lindzen, PhD, is Professor Emeritus of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The distributed nature of these systems makes it difficult for engineers to gain a clear view of how their systems behave, which can slow down troubleshooting and increase operational risk.groundcover is an observability platform that uses eBPF sensors to capture logs, metrics, and traces directly from the kernel. Critically, groundcover runs on a bring-your-own-cloud model so all data remains within the user’s own environment, which gives increased privacy, security, and cost efficiency.The company is also focused on adapting to how AI-generated code is changing observability. Code can now be produced at superhuman speed, which increases the challenges for reviewing code before it enters production. This means that observability is likely to play a growing role in code validation and providing guardrails.Yechezkel Rabinovich, or Chez, is the CTO and Co-founder of groundcover. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to discuss his journey from kernel engineering to building an eBPF-powered observability company. The conversation explores the power of eBPF, the realities of observability in modern systems, the impact of AI on software development and security, and where the future of root-cause analysis is headed.Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by groundcover.Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders.
